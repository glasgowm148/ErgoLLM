Using the following style, explain what this plugin is about, be concise and clear and informative, speak as a human would in natural language. Only suggest prompts that can be executed based on the available functions and parameters.

If multiple plugins are enabled, run this prompt on each one in turn.

Output the plug-in title in a header.

**Description:** Concise description

**Available Function(s) and Parameters:** List all available functions and their parameters. Ensure that parameters are listed.

**Basic Prompt:** Simple prompt in natural language that shows off the intended use of the plug-in

**Use Case Interpretation:** How the plugin can help the user or improve their life or solve a problem, etc.

**Advanced Prompts:** 3 prompts that are more detailed, or have several different considerations for the plug-in, but ensure that the plug-in can actually complete the advanced prompts, i.e. if the plug-in does not have a function for description search do not include it. Each prompt should be entirely different than the other two, in both idea, structure and purpose. 

**Unusual Prompts:** 3 prompts that the makers of the plug-in did not anticipate, they can be silly, or highly creative, or tests the limit of the plug-ins capability, or simply not a prompt that most people would think of. Each prompt should be entirely different than the other two, in both idea, structure and purpose and be unique and completely different than the advanced prompts. The unusual prompts should showcase out-of the-box ways to use the plug-in, they should be creative.

**Multi-Step Prompts:** Indicate whether the plugin is capable of multi-step prompts and if so, give three unique examples, if not then show three examples of using the plug-in in conjunction with other plug-ins to achieve unique solutions to problems. For those examples, make three creative, unique, useful, out-of-the-box choices from the following plug-in list. Note: Some plugins are described in parentheses. Choose plugins based on their descriptions. For instance, Metaphor is not a plugin about metaphors. Check all descriptions before outputting examples: Wolfram Alpha, Zapier, WebPilot (Browse & QA Webpage/PDF/Data. Generate articles, from one or more URLs), VoxScript (Enables searching of YouTube transcripts, Pastebin, Github, financial data sources, and Google Search results), Noteable (Create notebooks in Python, SQL, and Markdown to explore data, visualize, and share notebooks with everyone), Prompt Perfect (Craft the perfect AI Large Language Model prompt), Link Reader (Reads the content of all kinds of links, like webpage, PDF, PPT, image, Word), Show Me (Create and edit diagrams directly in chat), Expedia, AskYourPDF, BlockAtlas (Search the US Census! Find data sets, ask questions, and visualize), Scraper (Scrape content from webpages by providing a URL), There's An AI For That (Find the right AI tools for any use case, from the world's largest database of AI tools), Speechki (Convert texts to ready-to-use audio â€” download link, audio player page, or embed), Access Link (Access any links on the web and get the information you need), Glowing (Schedule and send daily SMS messages - reminders, inspiration, helpers and more), Web Requests (Your AI assistant's web browser. Just enter a URL. Google, Wiki, GitHub.)

Use markdown for readability.
