---------------Wall of Text--------------------

"Provide a comprehensive, fact-checked, logical, multiperspectival, and ultrametaperspective analysis of X while aiming for epistemic humility, practicing metacognition, interrogating assumptions, reducing cognitive biases, embracing fallibilism, embracing creative possibilities, contextualizing historically and globally, considering hidden interconnections, and questioning priorities and values. Seek information challenging initial hypotheses. Rely only on statistically valid data. Acknowledge complexity and nuances. Identify underlying assumptions. Consider minority views and marginalized voices. Situate topics within historical context. Recognize spectrums, third alternatives, and long term impacts. Remain open to being mistaken. Identify systemic causes and effects. Note information that is unknown. Step back to analyze your own analysis. Avoid presentism. Generate possibilities beyond status quo thinking. Search broadly for additional evidence and perspectives. Practice humility. Recognize future insights may differ."

---------------Analysis Style Guide---------------

Style Guide

I. Principles

1) Interrogate assumptions

a) Discuss historical/cultural forces shaping any implicit or explicit assumptions in the prompt or topic   

b) Identify and challenge assumptions using techniques to minimize cognitive biases
2) Consider multiple perspectives

a) Incorporate views of minority groups and marginalized communities  

b) Integrate alternative perspectives from different philosophical and cultural vantage points     
3) Adopt an ultrameta lens

a) Examine topic from broadest historical, sociological and cosmological contexts    

b) Identify systemic causes and effects shaping the topic at global and universal scales
4) Embrace epistemic humility

a) Acknowledge unknown information and limitations of one's current knowledge      

b) Employ metacognition to critically reflect on and improve one's analysis     
II. Methodology

1) Fact check all claims against credible sources

2) Gather diverse sources that challenge initial assumptions

3) Generate alternate hypotheses to test against initial claims

4) Identify binary framings and consider alternatives beyond false dichotomies

5) Question priorities, rankings and values underlying any given prompt or topic

6) Analyze one's own analysis to identify blindspots

7) Generate possibilities that substantially revise current understanding

8) Remain open to alternative future insights that upend current analyse

----------20 out of 100 cognitive biases/blindspots covered so far---------

Potential Blind Spots and Additional Input to Consider:

Confirmation bias - Seek out information that challenges initial hypotheses

Anecdotal evidence - Rely only on statistically valid data

Oversimplification - Acknowledge complexity and nuances

Unexamined assumptions - Identify and interrogate underlying assumptions

Lack of multiple perspectives - Consider minority views and marginalized voices

Ignoring historical context - Situate topics within relevant historical contexts

False dichotomies - Recognize spectrums, nuances and third alternatives

Emotional reactivity - Respond from a place of calm reflection

Single solution thinking - Generate multiple possible solutions and approaches

Short term thinking - Consider long term impacts and ramifications

...

Truth bias - Remain open to the possibility of being mistaken
Illusory superiority - Acknowledge personal limitations and knowledge gaps
Missing interconnections - Identify systemic causes and effects
Incomplete information - Note information that is currently unknown
Failure to meta-analyze - Step back to analyze the analysis itself
Presentism - Avoid evaluating the past based on present-day assumptions
Lack of imagination - Generate possibilities beyond status quo thinking
Tunnel vision - Search broadly for additional perspectives and evidence
Self-righteousness - Practice humility to remain open to growth
Arrogance of the present - Recognize future generations may see things differently
