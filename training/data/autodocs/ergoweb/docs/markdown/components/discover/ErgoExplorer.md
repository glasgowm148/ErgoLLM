The code is a React component that renders a section of the Ergoweb project's website called "Explore". The purpose of this component is to provide users with two buttons that allow them to interact with the Ergo blockchain. The first button takes users to the Ergo Explorer, which is a tool that allows them to view every transaction made on the blockchain in real-time. The second button takes users to ergo.watch, which is a website that provides community-curated metrics on the Ergo blockchain.

The component uses the `Link` component from the `next/link` library to create links to the Ergo Explorer and ergo.watch. The `useIntl` hook from the `react-intl` library is used to provide internationalization support for the component. The `getIconComponentByName` function from the `../../utils/icons-map` file is used to render an arrow icon next to each button.

The `Explore` component returns a JSX element that contains two buttons wrapped in `Link` components. Each button has an `onClick` event handler that takes users to the Ergo Explorer or ergo.watch when clicked. The text for each button is obtained using the `intl.formatMessage` method, which takes an object with an `id` and `defaultMessage` property. The `id` property is used to look up the text for the button in a translation file, while the `defaultMessage` property provides a fallback value if the translation is not available.

Overall, this component provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with the Ergo blockchain. By clicking on one of the buttons, users can access real-time transaction data or community-curated metrics, depending on their needs. The use of internationalization support ensures that the component is accessible to users from different countries and language backgrounds.
