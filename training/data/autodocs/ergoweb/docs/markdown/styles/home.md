This file contains CSS code that defines the styling for various elements on the homepage of the ergoweb project. The purpose of this code is to create a visually appealing and responsive design for the homepage. 

The code defines the styling for several elements, including frames and blur effects. Each element is positioned absolutely on the page and given a specific width and height. The frames are given a background image and a drop shadow effect, while the blur effects are given a background image and a blur filter. 

The code also includes media queries that adjust the styling of the elements based on the screen size. For example, when the screen size is smaller, some elements are hidden and others are scaled down. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the ergoweb project as it defines the visual design of the homepage. It can be used to ensure that the homepage looks consistent and professional across different devices and screen sizes. 

Example usage:
```html
<div class="home-frame-1"></div>
<div class="home-blur-1"></div>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@import "./_variables.scss";` statement at the beginning of the file?
- This statement imports the `_variables.scss` file into the current file, allowing the use of variables defined in that file throughout this file.

2. What is the purpose of the media queries at the end of the file?
- The media queries adjust the styles of certain elements based on the screen size of the device being used to view the website. This allows for a responsive design that looks good on screens of different sizes.

3. What is the purpose of the `z-index` property used in some of the CSS rules?
- The `z-index` property determines the stacking order of elements on the page. Elements with a higher `z-index` value will appear on top of elements with a lower `z-index` value. This is useful for controlling the layering of elements in a complex layout.
