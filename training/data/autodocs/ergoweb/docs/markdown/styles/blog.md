The code above defines the styling for the blog page of the Ergoweb project. It sets the position, size, and background images for three blog frames, two blur effects, and a blog post. It also includes media queries to adjust the styling for different screen sizes.

The `blog-frame-1` class defines the styling for the main blog frame. It sets the position to absolute, the width to 527px, the height to 283px, and the background image to "/assets/blog/frame-1-light.png". It also applies a drop shadow filter. The `dark` class modifies the styling for the dark mode of the website by changing the background image to "/assets/blog/frame-1.png".

The `blog-frame-2` and `blog-frame-3` classes define the styling for the two smaller blog frames. They set the position to absolute, the width to 185px, the height to 1265px, and the background image to "/assets/blog/frame-2.png". The `dark` class modifies the styling for the dark mode of the website by keeping the same background image.

The `blog-blur-1` and `blog-blur-2` classes define the styling for the two blur effects. They set the position to absolute, the width and height to specific values, and the background image to "/assets/blog/blur-1.svg" and "/assets/blog/blur-2.svg", respectively. The `dark` class modifies the styling for the dark mode of the website by keeping the same background image.

The `blog-post` class sets the maximum width of the blog post to 384px.

The media queries adjust the styling for different screen sizes. For screens with a maximum width of `$lg`, the `blog-frame-1` class is scaled down and moved to the left. For screens with a maximum width of `$md` and `$xs`, the `blog-frame-1`, `blog-frame-2`, and `blog-frame-3` classes are scaled down and moved to specific positions. The `blog-blur-1` and `blog-blur-2` classes are also scaled down and moved to specific positions.

Overall, this code defines the styling for the blog page of the Ergoweb project and ensures that it is responsive to different screen sizes. It can be used in conjunction with other code files to create a fully functional blog page.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@import "./_variables.scss";` statement at the beginning of the code?
- This statement imports variables from a separate Sass file called `_variables.scss`, which can be used throughout the rest of the code.

2. What is the significance of the `.dark` class in relation to the `.blog-frame-1`, `.blog-frame-2`, and `.blog-frame-3` classes?
- The `.dark` class is used to apply different styles to the frames when the page is in "dark mode". In this case, the background image for the frames changes.

3. What is the purpose of the media queries at the end of the code?
- The media queries adjust the styles of the frames and blur effects based on the size of the screen. This allows the layout to be responsive and adapt to different devices.
