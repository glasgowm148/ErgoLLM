This code exports a React component called `EcosystemPage` that renders the `Ecosystem` component from the `../../pages/ecosystem` file. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to render the `Ecosystem` component as a standalone page within the larger project. 

The `title` property is used by the Storybook tool to display the name of the component in the UI. The `component` property specifies the component that will be rendered in the Storybook preview pane. 

The `EcosystemPage` component is a functional component that simply renders the `Ecosystem` component. This allows the `Ecosystem` component to be easily reused in other parts of the project, while also providing a standalone page for users to view the ecosystem data. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import EcosystemPage from "./components/EcosystemPage";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Ergoweb Ecosystem</h1>
      <EcosystemPage />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `EcosystemPage` component is imported and rendered within the `App` component. This allows the `Ecosystem` component to be displayed as a standalone page within the larger Ergoweb project.
