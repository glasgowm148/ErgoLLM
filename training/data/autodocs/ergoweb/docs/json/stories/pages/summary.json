This component can be used in other parts of the ergoweb project to display a custom 404 page when a user navigates to a non-existent page.\n\nFor example, in a routing configuration file, the `Custom404Page` component can be specified as the component to render when a route does not match any of the defined routes. This ensures that users are presented with a user-friendly error page instead of a generic browser error message.\n\n```javascript\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Custom404Page from \"./Custom404Page\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={HomePage} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/about\" component={AboutPage} />\n        <Route component={Custom404Page} />\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `Custom404Page` component is specified as the component to render when none of the defined routes match the user's requested URL.
