  "summary": "This code exports a storybook story for the `Post` component, which is located in the `../../pages/blog/[id]` file. The `Post` component is used to display a blog post on the website. \n\nThe `PostPage` function is the main component that is exported. It takes two arguments: `args` and `{ loaded: { post } }`. The `args` argument is used to pass any props to the `Post` component, while the `{ loaded: { post } }` argument is used to pass the `post` object to the `Post` component. \n\nThe `PostPage` function is used to render the `Post` component with the `post` object passed as a prop. This function is used in the storybook story to display the `Post` component with sample data. \n\nThe `PostPage.story` object is used to set the parameters for the storybook story. In this case, the `nextRouter` object is used to set the path, asPath, and query parameters for the story. This is used to simulate the behavior of the `Post` component when it is rendered on the website. \n\nThe `PostPage.loaders` array is used to define the data loading function for the `Post` component. In this case, the `getServerSideProps` function is used to fetch the data for the `Post` component. The `getServerSideProps` function takes a query object as an argument, which is used to fetch the data for the specific blog post. \n\nOverall, this code is used to define the storybook story for the `Post` component and to set the data loading function for the component. This allows developers to test and preview the `Post` component with sample data in the storybook environment.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Post` component being imported and used in this file?\n- The `Post` component is being used as a component in this file and is also being passed as a prop to the `PostPage` component.\n\n2. What is the `nextRouter` parameter in the `PostPage` story used for?\n- The `nextRouter` parameter is used to define the path, asPath, and query for the Next.js router when rendering the `PostPage` component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `loaders` array in the `PostPage` component?\n- The `loaders` array is used to define an asynchronous function that retrieves data for the `PostPage` component using the `getServerSideProps` function and returns the props for the component."
