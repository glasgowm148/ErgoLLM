  "summary": "The `SvgX` component is a React functional component that renders an SVG image of an X symbol. The SVG has a width and height of 43 pixels and consists of two paths. The first path is a circle with a stroke color of `#585858` and a stroke width of 2. The second path is the X symbol itself, which is filled with the same color.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a reusable component for displaying an X symbol in various contexts. For example, it could be used as an icon for a delete button or to indicate a close action. The component can be imported and used in other React components like so:\n\n```\nimport SvgX from 'path/to/SvgX';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Are you sure you want to delete?</h2>\n      <button onClick={handleDelete}>\n        <SvgX />\n        Delete\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SvgX` component is used as an icon next to the \"Delete\" button to indicate that clicking the button will delete something. The `SvgX` component can be easily customized by passing props like `width`, `height`, and `color` to change its appearance.",
