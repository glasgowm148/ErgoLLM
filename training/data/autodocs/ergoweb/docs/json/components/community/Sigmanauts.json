  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a section of the Ergoweb website called \"Sigmanauts\". The purpose of this component is to provide information about the Sigmanaut Training Programme and encourage users to apply for it. \n\nThe component imports two modules from external libraries: `FormattedMessage` and `useIntl` from `react-intl`, and `Button` from a custom component. `FormattedMessage` is used to display localized text, while `useIntl` is used to format the text based on the user's locale. `Button` is a custom component that renders a button with various properties such as text, URL, and icon.\n\nThe `Sigmanauts` component consists of two main sections: an image and a text section. The image section displays an icon retrieved from a custom `icons-map` module using the `getIconComponentByName` function. The text section displays the title, subtitle, and description of the Sigmanaut Training Programme. The title and subtitle are displayed in two different formats depending on the screen size. The description is displayed using the `FormattedMessage` component, which allows for the use of variables and HTML tags.\n\nFinally, the component renders a `Button` component that encourages users to apply for the programme. The text of the button is retrieved from the `intl` object using the `formatMessage` function, which formats the text based on the user's locale. The `Button` component also has various properties such as URL, icon, and color, which are used to customize its appearance.\n\nOverall, the `Sigmanauts` component is an important part of the Ergoweb website as it provides information about a key programme and encourages users to apply for it. The use of localized text and custom components makes the component more accessible and user-friendly.",
