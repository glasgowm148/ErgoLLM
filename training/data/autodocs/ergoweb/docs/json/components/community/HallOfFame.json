  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `HallOfFame` that displays a list of people involved in the Ergo project. The component imports several other components and icons, including `Tab` from `@headlessui/react`, `Image` from `next/image`, `Link` from `next/link`, `FormattedMessage` from `react-intl`, and several custom icons. \n\nThe `HallOfFame` component takes an optional prop called `teamMembers`, which is an array of objects representing people involved in the project. Each object has several properties, including `name`, `bio`, `github`, `linkedin`, `twitter`, and `image`. \n\nThe `HallOfFame` component renders a tabbed interface with three tabs: \"CORE\", \"COMMUNITY\", and \"FOUNDATION\". Each tab displays a list of people from the `teamMembers` array whose `group` property matches the name of the tab. The list is displayed using the `GroupPersons` function, which takes two arguments: the `teamMembers` array and the name of the group to display. \n\nThe `GroupPersons` function filters the `teamMembers` array to include only those objects whose `group` property matches the specified group name. It then maps over the filtered array and renders a `HallOfFamePerson` component for each person. \n\nThe `HallOfFamePerson` component takes several props representing information about a person, including their name, bio, social media links, and image. It renders a card with a flip animation that displays the person's image on the front and their bio on the back. The component also displays the person's name and social media links below the card. \n\nOverall, the `HallOfFame` component provides a way to showcase the people involved in the Ergo project and highlight their contributions. The tabbed interface allows users to easily switch between different groups of people, and the `HallOfFamePerson` component provides a visually appealing way to display information about each person.",

What is the `GroupPersons` function used for?\n- The `GroupPersons` function filters the list of people passed as `data` based on their `group` attribute, and returns a list of `HallOfFamePerson` components for each person in the filtered list.\n\n3. What libraries and components are being imported in this file?\n- The file imports `Tab` from `@headlessui/react`, `Image` from `next/image`, `Link` from `next/link`, `FormattedMessage` from `react-intl`, and several custom icons.
