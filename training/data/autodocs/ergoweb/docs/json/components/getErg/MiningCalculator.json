  "summary": "The `MiningCalculator` component is responsible for calculating the daily revenue of mining ERG (Ergo) cryptocurrency based on the user's input of their hashrate. The component takes in four props: `currentPrice`, `currentBlockReward`, `networkHashrate`, and `difficulty`. \n\nThe component uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of the user's inputted hashrate. The `dailyRevenueERG` variable is initialized to 0 and will be updated based on the user's input. The `blockTime` variable is set to 120 seconds (2 minutes), which is the time it takes to mine a block in the Ergo blockchain. The `blocksPerDay` variable is calculated by dividing the number of seconds in a day (86400) by the `blockTime`. \n\nThe `if` statement checks if the user's input is a valid number. If it is, the `dailyRevenueERG` variable is calculated using the formula: \n\n```\n((1000000 * props.currentBlockReward * parseFloat(hashRate) * blockTime) / props.difficulty) * blocksPerDay;\n```\n\nThis formula takes into account the current block reward, the user's hashrate, the block time, and the network difficulty to calculate the daily revenue in ERG. \n\nThe component returns a JSX element that displays the mining calculator UI. The UI consists of two columns: one for the user's input and one for the calculated results. The user's input is a text input field that accepts a number value for the hashrate. The calculated results display the daily revenue in ERG and the equivalent USD value based on the `currentPrice` prop. The UI also displays the current price, current block reward, and network hashrate for reference. \n\nOverall, the `MiningCalculator` component provides a simple way for users to calculate their potential daily revenue from mining ERG based on their hashrate and the current network conditions. It can be used as a tool for miners to make informed decisions about their mining operations.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a React component for a mining calculator that calculates daily revenue based on user inputted hashrate and current cryptocurrency market data.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports the `useState` hook from the `react` library.\n\n3. What is the formula used to calculate `dailyRevenueERG`?\n- `dailyRevenueERG` is calculated as `((1000000 * props.currentBlockReward * parseFloat(hashRate) * blockTime) / props.difficulty) * blocksPerDay`, where `hashRate` is the user inputted hashrate, `blockTime` is a constant value of 120 seconds, and `blocksPerDay` is calculated as `86400 / blockTime`."
