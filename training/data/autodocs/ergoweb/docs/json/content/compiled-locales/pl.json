  "summary": "This code is a JSON object containing key-value pairs that represent various text elements and their translations for the Ergoweb project. The keys are organized in a hierarchical structure, with the main categories being components, footer, navigation, and pages. Each category contains subcategories and specific text elements, such as titles, subtitles, and button labels.\n\nFor example, under the `components` category, there are keys for `ContributeForm`, `DApps`, `Sigmanauts`, and more. Each of these keys contains an array of objects with `type` and `value` properties. The `type` property indicates the formatting of the text, while the `value` property contains the actual translated text.\n\n```json\n\"components.ContributeForm.company.subTitle\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": 0,\n    \"value\": \"Chcesz zostać partnerem?\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `components.ContributeForm.company.subTitle` key represents the subtitle for the company section in the ContributeForm component. The `value` property contains the translated text in Polish: \"Chcesz zostać partnerem?\".\n\nSimilarly, the `footer` category contains keys for various sections of the website's footer, such as `blog`, `community`, `discover`, and `ecosystem`. The `navigation` category contains keys for the main navigation menu items, and the `pages` category contains keys for specific page titles and content.\n\nThis JSON object is likely used in the Ergoweb project to display translated text based on the user's language preferences. By organizing the translations in this structured format, it becomes easier to manage and update the text content across the entire project.",
