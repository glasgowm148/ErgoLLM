  "summary": "The code above is responsible for styling the community page of the Ergoweb project. It defines the position, size, and background image of various frames and blurs that are used to create the visual layout of the page. \n\nThe code is divided into several sections, each of which defines the properties of a specific frame or blur. Each section begins with a class selector that identifies the HTML element to which the styles should be applied. For example, the first section targets an element with the class \"community-frame-1\". \n\nWithin each section, there are several CSS properties that define the appearance of the element. These include \"position\", which specifies the positioning of the element relative to its parent container, \"width\" and \"height\", which set the size of the element, and \"background\", which sets the background image of the element. \n\nIn addition to the basic styles, there are also several media queries that adjust the positioning and scaling of the elements based on the size of the viewport. For example, the \".community-frame-8\" element is scaled down and repositioned when the viewport width is less than the value of the \"$xl\" variable. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the Ergoweb project's community page, as it defines the visual layout of the page and ensures that it is responsive to different screen sizes. Developers working on this project would need to understand this code in order to make changes to the community page or to create new pages with a similar layout. \n\nExample usage:\n\nTo apply the styles defined in this code to an HTML element with the class \"community-frame-1\", you would add the following code to your CSS file:\n\n```\n.community-frame-1 {\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 1465px;\n  height: 324px;\n  top: 0px;\n  right: 0px;\n  background: no-repeat url(\"/assets/community/frame-1-light.png\");\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `@import \"./_variables.scss\";` statement at the beginning of the code?\n- This statement imports variables from another file called `_variables.scss` which can be used throughout the code.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the media queries at the end of the code?\n- The media queries adjust the positioning and scaling of the elements based on the screen size, allowing the layout to be responsive.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `.dark` class used in some of the CSS selectors?\n- The `.dark` class is used to apply different styles to the elements when the page is in a dark mode or low-light setting."
