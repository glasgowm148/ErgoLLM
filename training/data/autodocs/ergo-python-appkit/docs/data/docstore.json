A box is a container that holds value and tokens, and can be locked with a script that defines the conditions for spending the box. The `ErgoBox` class takes as input an instance of `ErgoAppKit`, which provides access to the Ergo blockchain, a value (an integer representing the amount of value held in the box), an instance of `ErgoContract` that defines the locking script for the box, and optionally a dictionary of tokens (where the keys are token IDs and the values are token amounts) and a list of registers (which are used to store data in the box).\n\nThe `ErgoBox` class has several properties and methods that allow for interacting with the box. The `outBox` property returns an instance of `OutBox`, which represents an output box that can be included in a transaction to create a new box on the blockchain. The `inputBox` method takes as input a transaction ID and an index, and returns an instance of `InputBox`, which represents an input box that can be included in a transaction to spend the box. The `inputBox` method converts the `OutBox` instance returned by the `outBox` property to an `InputBox` instance.\n\nThe `ErgoBox` class also has several getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the properties of the box, including the `appKit` property (which provides access to the `ErgoAppKit` instance), the `value` property (which represents the amount of value held in the box), the `contract` property (which represents the locking script for the box), the `tokens` property (which represents the tokens held in the box), and the `registers` property (which represents the data stored in the box).\n\nOverall, the `ErgoBox` class provides a convenient way to interact with boxes on the Ergo blockchain, allowing for the creation and spending of boxes, as well as the manipulation of box properties. This class is likely to be used extensively in the larger `ergo-python-appkit` project, which provides a Python interface for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. An example usage of the `ErgoBox` class might look like this:\n\n```\nfrom ergo_python_appkit import ErgoAppKit\nfrom org.ergoplatform.appkit import ErgoContract\n\nappKit = ErgoAppKit()\ncontract = ErgoContract.compile(\"sigmaProp(true)\")\n\nbox = ErgoBox(appKit, 1000000, contract)\n\noutBox = box.outBox\ninputBox = box.inputBox()\n\nprint(outBox)\nprint(inputBox)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `ErgoBox` that represents a box in the Ergo blockchain. It has properties for value, contract, tokens, and registers, and methods for creating an output box and converting it to an input box.\n\n2. What is the `ErgoAppKit` class and where does it come from?\n- The `ErgoAppKit` class is imported from the `ergo_python_appkit.appkit` module. It is not clear from this code where that module comes from or what the `ErgoAppKit` class does.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `tokens` and `registers` properties of the `ErgoBox` class?\n- The `tokens` property is a dictionary that maps token IDs to amounts, representing the tokens contained in the box. The `registers` property is a list of `ErgoValue` objects representing the values stored in the box's registers.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/ergo_python_appkit/ErgoBox.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergo-pad/ergo-python-appkit/ergo_python_appkit/ErgoContractBase.py)\n\nThe code defines a class called `ErgoContractBase` which serves as a base class for creating Ergo contracts in the `ergo-python-appkit` project. The class takes in an instance of `ErgoAppKit`, a script string, a mapping dictionary, and an `ErgoTree` object as parameters. \n\nThe `__init__` method initializes the class instance by setting the `appKit` attribute to the passed-in `ErgoAppKit` instance. If a script string is provided, it reads the script from the file and compiles it into an `ErgoTree` object using the `compileErgoScript` method of the `appKit` instance. If an `ErgoTree` object is provided, it sets the `_ergoTree` attribute to it. Finally, it creates an `ErgoContract` object from the `_ergoTree` attribute using the `contractFromTree` method of the `appKit` instance.\n\nThe `validateInputBox` method takes an `InputBox` object as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the `ErgoTree` of the input box matches the `_ergoTree` attribute of the class instance. This method can be used to validate whether an input box is compatible with the contract.\n\nThe class also defines getter and setter methods for the `contract` and `appKit` attributes. These methods allow access to and modification of the private attributes `_contract` and `_appKit`, respectively.\n\nOverall, this class provides a base implementation for creating Ergo contracts in the `ergo-python-appkit` project. It allows for the compilation of Ergo scripts into `ErgoTree` objects and the creation of `ErgoContract` objects from those trees. The `validateInputBox` method can be used to ensure that input boxes are compatible with the contract.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a base class for Ergo contracts in Python, which includes methods for initializing the contract and validating input boxes.\n\n2. What external libraries or modules does this code use?\n- This code imports several modules from the `ergo_python_appkit` and `org.ergoplatform.appkit` packages, as well as the `ErgoTree` class from `sigmastate.Values`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `@property` and `@property.setter` decorators in this code?\n- These decorators define getter and setter methods for the `contract` and `appKit` attributes of the `ErgoContractBase` class, allowing them to be accessed and modified like regular attributes while also providing additional functionality.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/ergo_python_appkit/ErgoContractBase.md"}}],["2",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergo-pad/ergo-python-appkit/ergo_python_appkit/ErgoTransaction.py)\n\nThe `ErgoTransaction` class is a part of the `ergo-python-appkit` project and provides functionality for building and signing Ergo transactions. \n\nThe class takes an instance of `ErgoAppKit` as an argument in its constructor, which is used to access the necessary methods for building and signing transactions. The `preHeader` attribute is set to the preHeader of the `ErgoAppKit` instance.\n\nThe class provides several properties for setting and getting various attributes of the transaction, such as inputs, outputs, fees, and tokens to burn. These properties use getters and setters to ensure that the attributes are properly formatted and validated before being set.\n\nThe `unsignedTx` property returns an `UnsignedTransaction` object that is built using the inputs, outputs, fee, change address, tokens to burn, data inputs, and preHeader attributes. This property is used to obtain the unsigned transaction that can be signed later.\n\nThe `eip12` property returns a JSON representation of the unsigned transaction using the `unsignedTxToJson` method of the `ErgoAppKit` class. This property is used to obtain the unsigned transaction in a format that can be used with the EIP-12 standard.\n\nThe `ergoPaySigningRequest` property returns a signing request for the transaction using the `formErgoPaySigningRequest` method of the `ErgoAppKit` class. This property is used to obtain a signing request that can be used with the ErgoPay protocol.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoTransaction` class provides a convenient way to build and sign Ergo transactions using the `ergo-python-appkit` library.

This function takes a set of inputs, outputs, and other parameters, and returns a signed transaction that can be broadcast to the network. \n\nFor example, the following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `create_transaction` function to create a new transaction that sends Ergs from one address to another:\n\n```python\nfrom ergo_appkit import create_transaction\n\n# Define the inputs and outputs for the transaction\ninputs = [{'boxId': 'input_box_id', 'spendingProof': 'input_spending_proof'}]\noutputs = [{'value': 1000000, 'address': 'recipient_address'}]\n\n# Create the transaction\ntx = create_transaction(inputs, outputs)\n\n# Broadcast the transaction to the network\nbroadcast_tx(tx)\n```\n\nIn addition to the `create_transaction` function, the module also provides a number of other utility functions for working with the Ergo blockchain. These include functions for querying the blockchain for information about boxes, transactions, and addresses, as well as functions for managing wallets and signing transactions. \n\nOverall, the Ergo Python Appkit project provides a powerful set of tools for working with the Ergo blockchain in Python, and the `ergo_appkit` module is an essential part of this toolkit.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the significance of the `json.loads` method being used in the `send_transaction` function?\n   - The `json.loads` method is used to convert the transaction data from a JSON string to a Python dictionary, which can be processed by the function.\n\n3. What is the expected input format for the `send_transaction` function?\n   - The `send_transaction` function expects a JSON string containing the transaction data, as well as a private key and the network to broadcast the transaction to.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/ergo_python_appkit/__init__.md"}}],["4",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergo-pad/ergo-python-appkit/ergo_python_appkit/appkit.py)\n\nThe `ErgoAppKit` class in this code provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. It allows users to perform various operations such as compiling ErgoScript, creating and signing transactions, and querying the blockchain for unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\n\nThe class constructor takes parameters such as `nodeUrl`, `networkType`, `explorerUrl`, and `nodeApiKey` to configure the connection to the Ergo node and the explorer API. It also initializes the `ApiClient` and `ErgoClient` instances for making API calls.\n\nSome key methods in the `ErgoAppKit` class include:\n\n- `compileErgoScript(ergoScript: str, constants: Dict[str,typing.Any] = {})`: Compiles an ErgoScript and returns an ErgoTree object.\n- `tree2Address(ergoTree)`: Converts an ErgoTree object to an Ergo address.\n- `buildOutBox(value: int, tokens: Dict[str,int], registers, contract)`: Builds an output box for a transaction.\n- `getBoxesById(boxIds: List[str])`: Retrieves input boxes by their IDs.\n- `mintToken(value: int, tokenId: str, tokenName: str, tokenDesc: str, mintAmount: int, decimals: int, contract: ErgoContract)`: Mints a new token.\n- `boxesToSpend(address: str, nergToSpend: int, tokensToSpend: Dict[str,int] = {}, includeMempool: bool = True)`: Finds UTXOs to spend for a given address and amount.\n- `buildUnsignedTransaction(inputs: List[InputBox], outputs: List[OutBox], fee: int, sendChangeTo: ErgoAddress, tokensToBurn: Dict[str,int] = None, dataInputs: List[InputBox] = None, preHeader: PreHeader = None)`: Builds an unsigned transaction.\n- `signTransaction(unsignedTx: UnsignedTransaction)`: Signs an unsigned transaction.\n- `sendTransaction(signedTx: SignedTransaction)`: Sends a signed transaction to the Ergo network.\n\nThese methods can be used in combination to create, sign, and send transactions on the Ergo blockchain. For example, to create a transaction, one can first use `boxesToSpend` to find UTXOs, then `buildOutBox` to create output boxes, and finally `buildUnsignedTransaction` to create the unsigned transaction. The unsigned transaction can then be signed using `signTransaction` and sent to the network using `sendTransaction`.\n\nAdditionally, the code provides utility functions for working with Ergo values, addresses, and ErgoScript, such as `ergoValue`, `dummyContract`, `contractFromTree`, and `contractFromAddress`. These functions can be used to manipulate Ergo data structures and interact with the Ergo blockchain more easily.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ErgoAppKit` class and its methods?\n   **Answer**: The `ErgoAppKit` class is a wrapper around various Ergo platform functionalities, such as creating and managing transactions, contracts, and addresses. Its methods provide a convenient way to interact with the Ergo blockchain, compile ErgoScript, create and sign transactions, and manage tokens and UTXOs.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `ErgoAppKit` handle different network types (mainnet and testnet)?\n   **Answer**: The `ErgoAppKit` handles different network types by using the `NetworkType` enumeration. When initializing the `ErgoAppKit` instance, the `networkType` parameter is passed, which can be either \"mainnet\" or \"testnet\". This parameter is then used to set the appropriate network type for the ErgoAddressEncoder and other related functionalities.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `ErgoAppKit` handle signing and sending transactions?\n   **Answer**: The `ErgoAppKit` provides methods for building unsigned transactions, signing them, and sending them to the Ergo network. The `buildUnsignedTransaction` method is used to create an unsigned transaction with the specified inputs, outputs, and other parameters. The `signTransaction` and `signTransactionWithNode` methods are used to sign the unsigned transaction using a local prover or the node's wallet API, respectively. Finally, the `sendTransaction` method is used to send the signed transaction to the Ergo network.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/ergo_python_appkit/appkit.md"}}],["5",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergo-pad/ergo-python-appkit/ergo_python_appkit/typings/jpype-stubs/py.typed)\n\nThe `partial` function in this code is a built-in Python function that allows for the creation of a new function with some of the arguments of an existing function already filled in. This is useful when you want to create a new function that is similar to an existing one, but with some of the arguments already set to specific values.\n\nIn the context of the `ergo-python-appkit` project, this `partial` function could be used to create new functions that are variations of existing functions in the project. For example, if there is a function in the project that takes three arguments, but you want to create a new function that only takes two of those arguments and has the third argument already set to a specific value, you could use the `partial` function to create this new function.\n\nHere is an example of how the `partial` function could be used in the `ergo-python-appkit` project:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndef existing_function(arg1, arg2, arg3):\n    # do something with arg1, arg2, and arg3\n    pass\n\n# create a new function that is a variation of existing_function\nnew_function = partial(existing_function, arg3=42)\n\n# call the new function with only two arguments\nnew_function(\"hello\", \"world\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `partial` function is used to create a new function called `new_function` that is a variation of an existing function called `existing_function`. The `arg3` argument of `existing_function` is set to the value `42` in the `partial` call, so the resulting `new_function` only takes two arguments instead of three. When `new_function` is called with only two arguments, the `arg3` argument is automatically set to `42`.\n\nOverall, the `partial` function is a useful tool for creating new functions that are variations of existing functions, and it can be used in a variety of ways in the `ergo-python-appkit` project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?** \n    - It is unclear from this snippet of code what the overall purpose of the `partial` function is within the `ergo-python-appkit` project.\n2. **What are the parameters and return value of the `partial` function?**\n    - Without additional context or documentation, it is unclear what parameters the `partial` function takes and what it returns.\n3. **How is the `partial` function used within the project?**\n    - It is unclear from this code snippet how the `partial` function is used within the `ergo-python-appkit` project and what other functions or modules it may interact with.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/ergo_python_appkit/typings/jpype-stubs/py.md"}}],["6",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergo-pad/ergo-python-appkit/.autodoc/docs/json/ergo_python_appkit/typings/jpype-stubs)\n\nThe `py.typed` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/ergo_python_appkit/typings/jpype-stubs` folder is an indicator that this package supports type hints.
