The `CustomMergeStrategy.scala` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/project` folder defines a custom merge strategy for the ergo project, specifically designed for merging configuration files. This custom strategy, named `concatReversed`, is an instance of the `MergeStrategy` trait, which provides a method `apply` that takes a temporary directory, a path, and a sequence of files as input, and returns either an error message or a sequence of pairs of files and paths.

The `concatReversed` merge strategy works by concatenating the contents of the input files in reverse order and writing the result to a new file in the temporary directory. The resulting file is then returned as a pair with the original path. The `IO.transfer` method is used to copy the contents of each input file to the output file, and the `IO.read` method is used to check if the last character of the input file is a newline character. If not, a newline character is added to the output file.

This custom merge strategy is designed to be used with the `sbtassembly` plugin, which is responsible for creating a single, executable JAR file from multiple project dependencies. The `sbtassembly` plugin allows users to specify custom merge strategies for handling conflicts between files with the same path. By using the `concatReversed` merge strategy, the ergo project can ensure that configuration files are merged in a consistent and predictable manner.

To use the `concatReversed` merge strategy in your project, you can import it and add it to the assembly merge strategy list as shown in the example below:

```scala
import sbtassembly.AssemblyPlugin.autoImport._

// Add the custom merge strategy to the assembly merge strategy list
assemblyMergeStrategy in assembly := {
  case "path/to/config/file" => CustomMergeStrategy.concatReversed
  case x => MergeStrategy.defaultMergeStrategy(x)
}
```

In this example, the `concatReversed` merge strategy is applied to a specific configuration file located at "path/to/config/file". For all other files, the default merge strategy is used. This ensures that the custom merge strategy is only applied to the desired configuration files, while the rest of the project files are handled using the default strategy.
