The `DerivationPath` class and its companion object in the `org.ergoplatform.wallet.secrets` package provide functionality for working with hierarchical deterministic (HD) key derivation paths. HD key derivation paths are used to derive a sequence of private and public keys from a single master key. The class represents a path as a sequence of integers, where each integer represents an index in the path. The companion object provides methods for encoding and decoding paths as strings, as well as finding the next available path index for a new key.

The `DerivationPath` class has several methods for working with paths. The `depth` method returns the number of elements in the path. The `index` method returns the last element of the path. The `isMaster` method returns true if the path is a master path (i.e., has only one element). The `encoded` method returns a string representation of the path that can be parsed back into a `DerivationPath` object. The `extended` method returns a new `DerivationPath` object with an additional index appended to the end of the path. The `increased` method returns a new `DerivationPath` object with the last index in the path incremented by one. The `toPublicBranch` and `toPrivateBranch` methods return new `DerivationPath` objects with the `publicBranch` flag set to true or false, respectively. The `isEip3` method returns true if the path corresponds to the EIP-3 standard.

The `DerivationPath` companion object provides a `fromEncoded` method that parses a string representation of a path into a `DerivationPath` object. The string representation must start with either "M" or "m" to indicate the master path, followed by a sequence of integers separated by slashes. If an integer ends with an apostrophe, it is treated as a hardened index. The companion object also provides a `nextPath` method that finds the next available path index for a new key. The method takes a sequence of `ExtendedSecretKey` objects and a boolean flag indicating whether to use the pre-EIP3 derivation path. If the sequence is empty or contains only a master key, the method returns the appropriate master path. Otherwise, if the last key corresponds to the EIP-3 path, the method returns a new path with the last index incremented by one. Otherwise, the method finds the maximum non-hardened index in the sequence and returns a new path with the last non-hardened index incremented by one.

The `DerivationPathSerializer` object provides serialization and deserialization methods for `DerivationPath` objects. The `serialize` method writes the `publicBranch` flag, the depth of the path, and each index in the path to a `Writer` object. The `parse` method reads these values from a `Reader` object and constructs a new `DerivationPath` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DerivationPath` class?
- The `DerivationPath` class represents a hierarchical deterministic (HD) key derivation path according to the BIP-32 specification, which is used to derive a sequence of private and public keys from a master key.

2. What is the difference between a public and private branch in a `DerivationPath`?
- A public branch is used to derive public keys, while a private branch is used to derive private keys. The difference is indicated by the prefix of the encoded path string, which is "M" for public and "m" for private.

3. What is the `nextPath` method used for in the `DerivationPath` object?
- The `nextPath` method is used to find the next available path index for a new key, given a sequence of previously generated secrets. It uses either the pre-EIP3 or EIP3 derivation path depending on a boolean flag, and increases the last segment of the path for EIP3 derivation or the last non-hardened segment for the old derivation. If all non-hardened indices are exhausted, it throws an exception.
