The code above defines a trait called `ScorexEncoding` that provides an implicit `ScorexEncoder` object. The purpose of this trait is to provide a way to encode bytes into strings. This trait is likely used in other parts of the `ergo` project to encode data for storage or transmission.

The `ScorexEncoder` object is not defined in this file, but it is likely defined in another file within the `ergo` project. It is also possible that this object is defined in a separate project called `ScorexUtils`, as indicated by the TODO comment in the code.

To use this trait, a class or object would need to extend it and then use the `encoder` object to encode bytes into strings. For example:

```scala
class MyClass extends ScorexEncoding {
  def encodeData(data: Array[Byte]): String = {
    encoder.encode(data)
  }
}
```

In the example above, `MyClass` extends `ScorexEncoding` and then defines a method called `encodeData` that takes an array of bytes and returns a string. The `encoder` object provided by the `ScorexEncoding` trait is used to encode the byte array into a string.

Overall, this code provides a simple way to encode bytes into strings and is likely used throughout the `ergo` project for various purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScorexEncoding` trait?
   - The `ScorexEncoding` trait provides a bytes to string encoder and is intended to be extracted to a separate project called `ScorexUtils`.
   
2. What is the `ScorexEncoder` used for?
   - The `ScorexEncoder` is used as the default encoder for the `ScorexEncoding` trait.
   
3. Why is there a TODO comment to extract the `ScorexEncoding` trait to a separate project?
   - The TODO comment suggests that the `ScorexEncoding` trait may be useful in other projects and should be extracted to a separate project for reusability.
