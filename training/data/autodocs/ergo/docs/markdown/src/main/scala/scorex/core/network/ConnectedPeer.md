The `ConnectedPeer` class represents a peer that is connected to the node. It contains information about the connection, such as the connection address (`connectionId`), a reference to the `PeerConnectionHandler` responsible for communication with this peer (`handlerRef`), the timestamp of the last received message (`lastMessage`), and information about the peer (`peerInfo`). The `peerInfo` field is optional and may be `None` if the peer is connected but has not yet completed the handshake process.

The `ConnectedPeer` class overrides the `hashCode`, `equals`, and `toString` methods. The `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the remote address of the connection. The `equals` method compares the remote address of the connection with another `ConnectedPeer` object. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `ConnectedPeer` object, including the connection information and the remote version of the peer.

The `ConnectedPeer` object contains an implicit `jsonEncoder` that encodes a `ConnectedPeer` object as a JSON object. The JSON object contains the remote address of the connection (`address`) and optional fields for the remote version of the peer (`version`) and the timestamp of the last received message (`lastMessage`). The `jsonEncoder` is used to encode `ConnectedPeer` objects as JSON when sending messages between nodes in the network.

Overall, the `ConnectedPeer` class and object provide a way to represent and encode information about peers that are connected to the node. This information can be used for communication and coordination between nodes in the network. For example, when a new node joins the network, it can use the `ConnectedPeer` information to establish connections with other nodes and exchange information about the state of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConnectedPeer` class?
- The `ConnectedPeer` class represents a peer that is connected to the node and contains information about the connection, the handler responsible for communication, the timestamp of the last received message, and information about the peer.

2. What is the purpose of the `jsonEncoder` in the `ConnectedPeer` object?
- The `jsonEncoder` is an implicit encoder that converts a `ConnectedPeer` object to a JSON object. It includes the remote address, protocol version, and timestamp of the last message received (if available).

3. What is the purpose of the `hashCode` and `equals` methods in the `ConnectedPeer` class?
- The `hashCode` method returns a hash code value for the `ConnectedPeer` object based on the remote address. The `equals` method compares two `ConnectedPeer` objects based on their remote addresses to determine if they are equal.
