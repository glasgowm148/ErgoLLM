The `PeerSynchronizer` class is responsible for discovering and sharing new peers in the network. It is part of the `ergo` project and is located in the `scorex.core.network` package. 

The class extends the `Actor` trait and mixes in the `Synchronizer` and `ScorexLogging` traits. It takes three parameters in its constructor: `networkControllerRef`, `peerManager`, and `settings`. The `networkControllerRef` is an `ActorRef` that represents the network controller actor. The `peerManager` is an `ActorRef` that represents the peer manager actor. The `settings` is an instance of the `NetworkSettings` class that contains various network settings.

The class overrides the `supervisorStrategy` method to define a `OneForOneStrategy` for handling exceptions. It also defines a `msgHandlers` partial function that handles incoming messages from remote peers. The `preStart` method is overridden to schedule a periodic message to the network controller actor to get peers. The `receive` method is overridden to handle incoming messages from remote peers.

The class has two private methods: `addNewPeers` and `gossipPeers`. The `addNewPeers` method takes a sequence of `PeerSpec` objects and adds them to the peer database if they were previously unknown. The `gossipPeers` method takes a remote peer and sends a message containing the locally known peer set to the remote peer.

Overall, the `PeerSynchronizer` class plays an important role in the `ergo` project by discovering and sharing new peers in the network. It communicates with the network controller and peer manager actors to achieve this.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is responsible for discovering and sharing new peers in a network.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on Akka and Scorex libraries.

3. What is the role of `msgHandlers` in this code?
- `msgHandlers` is a partial function that handles incoming messages from remote peers. It checks if the message is a `PeersSpec` or a `GetPeersSpec` and calls the appropriate method to add new peers or gossip about the locally known peer set to the remote peer.
