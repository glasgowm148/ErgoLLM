The code in this file is responsible for configuring various settings for the Ergo project. It covers settings related to the node, wallet, network, and caching. The node settings include options for state type, transaction verification, block storage, mining, and mempool management. The wallet settings cover secret storage, seed strength, mnemonic phrase language, and transaction fee management. The network settings handle connection management, peer discovery, and synchronization. The cache settings optimize memory usage for various components.

For example, in the node settings, `stateType` can be set to "utxo" or "digest" to determine how the node maintains its state. The `verifyTransactions` setting enables or disables transaction verification. The `blocksToKeep` setting determines how many blocks with transactions and ADproofs are stored.

In the wallet settings, `seedStrengthBits` determines the strength of the generated seed, and `mnemonicPhraseLanguage` sets the language for the mnemonic seed. The `defaultTransactionFee` sets the fee used when it's not specified in a transaction.

In the network settings, `knownPeers` is a list of well-known nodes to connect to, and `maxConnections` sets the maximum number of network connections. The `syncInterval` and `syncTimeout` settings control the synchronization process.

In the cache settings, various cache sizes are defined for different components, such as `blockSectionsCacheSize` for block sections and `headersCacheSize` for headers.

These configurations allow the Ergo project to be fine-tuned for different use cases and environments, ensuring optimal performance and resource usage.
## Questions: 
 1. **What are the different state types available and their purpose?**

   The available state types are "utxo" and "digest". The "utxo" state type keeps the full UTXO set, allowing the node to validate arbitrary blocks and generate ADProofs. The "digest" state type only keeps the state root hash and validates transactions via ADProofs.

2. **What is the purpose of the `blocksToKeep` setting?**

   The `blocksToKeep` setting determines the number of last blocks to keep with transactions and ADproofs. For all other blocks, only the header will be stored. If the value is negative, all blocks from the genesis will be kept.

3. **How does the `mempoolSorting` setting affect the mempool transaction handling?**

   The `mempoolSorting` setting determines the sorting scheme for transactions in the mempool. The available options are "random", "bySize", and "byExecutionCost". This affects the order in which transactions are processed and re-broadcasted.
