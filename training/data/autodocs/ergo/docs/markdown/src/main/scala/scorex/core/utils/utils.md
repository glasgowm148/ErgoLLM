The `utils` package contains a set of utility functions that can be used across the `ergo` project. 

The `profile` function takes a block of code and returns the execution time in seconds and the result of the block. This function can be used to profile the performance of different parts of the codebase.

The `toTry` function takes a boolean and a message and returns a `Try` object that is either a `Success` with `Unit` or a `Failure` with an exception containing the message. This function can be used to convert a boolean expression into a `Try` object.

The `untilTimeout` function takes a timeout duration, a delay duration, and a block of code. It repeatedly executes the block of code until it succeeds or the timeout duration is exceeded. If the block of code throws an exception, the function waits for the delay duration before trying again. This function can be used to repeatedly execute a block of code until it succeeds or a timeout is reached.

The `randomBytes` function takes an integer and returns an array of random bytes of the specified length. This function can be used to generate random data for cryptographic purposes.

The `concatBytes` function takes a sequence of byte arrays and concatenates them into a single byte array. This function can be used to combine multiple byte arrays into a single byte array.

The `concatFixLengthBytes` function takes a sequence of byte arrays and a length and concatenates them into a single byte array of the specified length. If the length is not specified, the length of the first byte array in the sequence is used. This function can be used to combine multiple byte arrays into a single byte array of a fixed length.

The `MapPimp` class is an implicit class that adds two methods to mutable maps: `adjust` and `flatAdjust`. The `adjust` method takes a key and a function that takes an optional value and returns a new value. If the key is present in the map, the function is applied to the value and the result is stored in the map. If the key is not present, nothing happens. The `flatAdjust` method is similar, but the function returns an optional value that determines whether the map should be updated or not. If the function returns `None`, the map is not updated. If the function returns `Some`, the value is stored in the map. These methods can be used to update mutable maps in a concise and readable way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `profile` function?
- The `profile` function takes a block of code as input and returns the execution time in seconds and the result of the block.

2. What is the difference between `concatBytes` and `concatFixLengthBytes`?
- `concatBytes` concatenates a sequence of byte arrays into a single byte array, while `concatFixLengthBytes` concatenates byte arrays of a fixed length.

3. What is the purpose of the `MapPimp` class?
- The `MapPimp` class provides two one-liner functions for updating a mutable map with the possibility to handle the case of a missing key.
