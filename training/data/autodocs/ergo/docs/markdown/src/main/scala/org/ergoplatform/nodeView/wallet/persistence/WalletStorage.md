The `WalletStorage` class is responsible for persisting the version-agnostic wallet actor's mutable state. This mutable state is not subject to rollbacks in case of forks, so it contains data that does not have different versions unlike blockchain-related objects. The data that is stored includes tracked addresses, derivation paths, changed addresses, ErgoStateContext, and external scans. 

The class provides methods to read, write, and remove data from the database. For example, `addPublicKeys` is used to store wallet-related public keys in the database, while `getPublicKey` is used to read the public key corresponding to a provided derivation path. The `updateStateContext` method writes the state context into the database, while `readStateContext` reads the state context from the database. 

The class also provides methods to manage external scans. The `addScan` method registers a new scan, while `removeScan` removes an existing scan from the database. The `getScan` method retrieves a scan by its identifier, and `allScans` reads all the scans from the database. 

The `WalletStorage` class is used in the larger project to persist the wallet's mutable state. It is used by the wallet actor to store and retrieve data from the database. For example, when a new public key is generated, it is stored in the database using the `addPublicKeys` method. When the wallet needs to read the state context, it uses the `readStateContext` method to retrieve it from the database. 

Overall, the `WalletStorage` class provides a way to persist the wallet's mutable state, which is essential for the wallet to function properly. It is used to store and retrieve data from the database, and it provides methods to manage external scans.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what data does it persist?
- This code persists version-agnostic wallet actor's mutable state, which includes tracked addresses, derivation paths, changed addresses, ErgoStateContext, and external scans.
2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including Guava, Scorex, and Blake2b256.
3. What methods are available for reading and writing data to the database?
- Methods available for reading and writing data to the database include `addPublicKeys`, `getPublicKey`, `readAllKeys`, `updateStateContext`, `readStateContext`, `updateChangeAddress`, `readChangeAddress`, `addScan`, `removeScan`, `getScan`, and `allScans`.
