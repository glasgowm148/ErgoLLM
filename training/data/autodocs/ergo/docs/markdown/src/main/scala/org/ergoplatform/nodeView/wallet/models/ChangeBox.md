The code defines a model for a change box in the Ergo wallet API. A change box is a type of output box that is created when a transaction spends more than one input box. The change box contains the leftover amount of Ergs and any other tokens that were not spent in the transaction. 

The `ChangeBox` class has two properties: `value` and `tokens`. `value` is a Long that represents the amount of Ergs in the change box. `tokens` is a Map that contains the IDs and amounts of other tokens in the change box. The `ModifierId` type is used as the key for the `tokens` map. 

The `ChangeBox` object defines two implicit encoders: `modifierIdEncoder` and `encoder`. `modifierIdEncoder` is a `KeyEncoder` that converts a `ModifierId` to a String. This is necessary because Circe, the JSON library used in the project, requires keys in JSON objects to be Strings. `encoder` is an `Encoder` that converts a `ChangeBox` instance to a JSON object. The `asJson` method is used to convert the `value` and `tokens` properties to JSON values and add them to the JSON object. 

This code is used in the larger Ergo project to represent change boxes in the wallet API. When a transaction is created in the Ergo system, the inputs and outputs are defined. If the sum of the inputs is greater than the sum of the outputs, a change box is created to hold the leftover amount. The `ChangeBox` model is used to represent this change box in the wallet API. 

Example usage:

```scala
import org.ergoplatform.nodeView.wallet.models.ChangeBox

val tokens = Map(
  "token1" -> 100L,
  "token2" -> 200L
)

val changeBox = ChangeBox(500L, tokens)

println(changeBox)
// Output: ChangeBox(500,Map(token1 -> 100, token2 -> 200))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall ergo project?
   This code defines a model for a wallet API box in the ergo project. It represents a box containing Ergs and other tokens.

2. What is the significance of the `KeyEncoder` and `DerivedObjectEncoder` traits being used in this code?
   The `KeyEncoder` trait is used to encode `ModifierId` keys as strings for serialization purposes. The `DerivedObjectEncoder` trait is used to automatically derive an encoder for the `ChangeBox` case class based on its structure.

3. What is the expected format of the JSON output produced by the `encoder` implicit value?
   The JSON output will have two fields: "value" representing the amount of Ergs in the box as a long integer, and "tokens" representing a map of `ModifierId` keys to long integer values representing the amounts of other tokens in the box.
