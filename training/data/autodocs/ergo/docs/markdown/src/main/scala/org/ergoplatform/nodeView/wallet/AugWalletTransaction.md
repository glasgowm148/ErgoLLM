The `AugWalletTransaction` object is a Scala case class that represents a wallet transaction augmented with the number of confirmations. It has a companion object that provides methods for encoding and decoding instances of this class to and from JSON format. 

The `boxEncoder` method is a helper method that takes an `ErgoAddressEncoder` instance and returns an `Encoder` for `ErgoBox` instances. It encodes an `ErgoBox` instance to a JSON object that contains the box ID, value, ErgoTree, address, assets, creation height, and additional registers. 

The `jsonEncoder` method is another helper method that takes an implicit `ErgoAddressEncoder` instance and returns an `Encoder` for `AugWalletTransaction` instances. It uses the `boxEncoder` method to encode the outputs of the wallet transaction to JSON format. The resulting JSON object contains the transaction ID, inputs, data inputs, outputs, size, inclusion height, scan IDs, and number of confirmations. 

The `jsonDecoder` method is an implicit `Decoder` for `AugWalletTransaction` instances. It decodes a JSON object to an `AugWalletTransaction` instance by first decoding the JSON object to an `ErgoTransaction` instance, then decoding the inclusion height, number of confirmations, and scan IDs from the JSON object. It then constructs an `AugWalletTransaction` instance using the decoded `ErgoTransaction`, inclusion height, scan IDs, and number of confirmations. 

This code is likely used in the larger project to encode and decode wallet transactions to and from JSON format. It provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize wallet transactions for storage or transmission over a network. For example, the `jsonEncoder` method could be used to encode a wallet transaction to JSON format before sending it over a network, and the `jsonDecoder` method could be used to decode the received JSON object back to an `AugWalletTransaction` instance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AugWalletTransaction` class?
   - The `AugWalletTransaction` class is a wallet transaction that includes the number of confirmations.
2. What is the `boxEncoder` method used for?
   - The `boxEncoder` method is used to encode an `ErgoBox` object into JSON format.
3. What is the purpose of the `jsonDecoder` method?
   - The `jsonDecoder` method is used to decode a JSON object into an `AugWalletTransaction` object.
