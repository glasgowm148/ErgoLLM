The `ConnectionId` class is a data structure that represents a connection between two network addresses. It contains three fields: `remoteAddress`, `localAddress`, and `direction`. The `remoteAddress` and `localAddress` fields are instances of the `InetSocketAddress` class, which represents a socket address (IP address and port number) on the internet. The `direction` field is an instance of the `ConnectionDirection` enumeration, which specifies whether the connection is incoming or outgoing.

This class is likely used in the larger project to keep track of connections between nodes in a peer-to-peer network. By creating a `ConnectionId` object for each connection, the project can uniquely identify each connection and perform actions based on its direction (e.g. only allow incoming connections from trusted nodes).

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the project:

```scala
import scorex.core.network.ConnectionId

// create a ConnectionId object for an incoming connection from 192.168.0.1:1234
val remoteAddress = new InetSocketAddress("192.168.0.1", 1234)
val localAddress = new InetSocketAddress("0.0.0.0", 5678) // assume this is the local address of the node
val connectionId = ConnectionId(remoteAddress, localAddress, ConnectionDirection.Incoming)

// print the connection ID
println(connectionId.toString)
// Output: ConnectionId(remote=/192.168.0.1:1234, local=/0.0.0.0:5678, direction=Incoming)
```

In this example, we create a `ConnectionId` object for an incoming connection from IP address `192.168.0.1` on port `1234`. We assume that the local address of the node is `0.0.0.0` on port `5678`. We set the `direction` field to `ConnectionDirection.Incoming` to indicate that this is an incoming connection. Finally, we print the `toString` representation of the `ConnectionId` object, which outputs a string that includes the remote address, local address, and direction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConnectionId` class?
   - The `ConnectionId` class is used to wrap a tuple of remote and local addresses along with a connection direction, allowing for precise identification of a peer in the network.

2. What is the significance of the `InetSocketAddress` class?
   - The `InetSocketAddress` class is used to represent a socket address (IP address + port number) and is used in this code to represent both the remote and local addresses of a peer.

3. What is the purpose of the `toString` method in the `ConnectionId` class?
   - The `toString` method is overridden in the `ConnectionId` class to provide a string representation of the `ConnectionId` object, including the remote and local addresses and the connection direction. This can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
