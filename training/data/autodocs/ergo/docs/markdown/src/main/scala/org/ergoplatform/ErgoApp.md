The `ErgoApp` class is the main entry point for the Ergo reference protocol client application. It is responsible for initializing and coordinating various components of the Ergo node, such as the network controller, peer manager, node view holder, and miners. 

The `ErgoApp` class takes in command line arguments and reads the configuration file to initialize the `ErgoSettings` object. It then creates an `ActorSystem` and sets up the necessary components for the Ergo node. 

The `ErgoApp` class creates an instance of the `ErgoNodeViewRef` class, which is responsible for managing the node's view of the blockchain. It also creates an instance of the `ErgoReadersHolderRef` class, which is responsible for managing the node's access to the blockchain data. 

If mining is enabled in the configuration file, the `ErgoApp` class creates an instance of the `ErgoMiner` class, which is responsible for mining new blocks. 

The `ErgoApp` class also creates an instance of the `PeerManagerRef` class, which is responsible for managing the node's connections to other nodes in the network. It sets up the necessary message handlers for the network controller and launches the `PeerSynchronizer` actor if peer discovery is enabled in the configuration file. 

The `ErgoApp` class sets up the necessary API routes for the Ergo node, such as the blockchain API, wallet API, and mining API. It also sets up the Swagger and NodePanel routes for the node. 

Finally, the `ErgoApp` class starts the HTTP server and binds it to the specified address and port. 

Overall, the `ErgoApp` class is responsible for initializing and coordinating the various components of the Ergo node, and provides an entry point for the Ergo reference protocol client application.
