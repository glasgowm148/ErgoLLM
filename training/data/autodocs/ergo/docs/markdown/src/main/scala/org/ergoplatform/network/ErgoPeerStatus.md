The code defines a container for the status of a peer in the Ergo network. The `ErgoPeerStatus` class has five parameters: `peer`, `status`, `height`, `lastSyncSentTime`, and `lastSyncGetTime`. 

The `peer` parameter is an instance of the `ConnectedPeer` class, which contains information about the peer's public address and operating mode. The `status` parameter is an instance of the `PeerChainStatus` class, which indicates whether the peer is ahead or behind the local blockchain or on a fork. The `height` parameter is an instance of the `Height` class, which represents the height of the peer's blockchain. The `lastSyncSentTime` and `lastSyncGetTime` parameters are optional instances of the `Time` class, which represent the last time the peer was asked to sync and the last time the peer received a sync, respectively.

The `ErgoPeerStatus` class also has two methods. The `mode` method is a helper method that returns the operating mode of the peer. The `version` method returns the protocol version of the peer.

The `ErgoPeerStatus` object contains an implicit `jsonEncoder` that encodes an instance of the `ErgoPeerStatus` class as a JSON object. The JSON object contains the following fields: `address`, `version`, `mode`, `status`, and `height`. The `address` field contains the peer's address as a string. The `version` field contains the peer's protocol version as a string. The `mode` field contains the peer's operating mode as a JSON object. The `status` field contains the peer's blockchain status as a string. The `height` field contains the peer's blockchain height as an integer.

This code is likely used in the larger Ergo project to manage and monitor the status of peers in the network. The `ErgoPeerStatus` class provides a convenient way to store and access information about a peer's status, while the `jsonEncoder` allows this information to be easily serialized and transmitted over the network. This information can be used to make decisions about which peers to connect to and which peers to avoid, as well as to monitor the health and performance of the network as a whole. 

Example usage:

```scala
val peer = ConnectedPeer(...)
val status = ErgoPeerStatus(peer, PeerChainStatus.OnFork, Height(100), Some(Time.now), None)
println(status.mode) // Some(ModePeerFeature.FullNode)
println(status.version) // Some(Version(1, 3, 0))
println(status.asJson) // {"address":"127.0.0.1:9053","version":"1.3.0","mode":{"mode":"full"},"status":"OnFork","height":100}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoPeerStatus` class?
- The `ErgoPeerStatus` class is a container for status information about another peer, including its blockchain status, height, and last sync times.

2. What is the `mode` field in `ErgoPeerStatus` and how is it determined?
- The `mode` field is an optional `ModePeerFeature` that represents the operating mode of the peer. It is determined by calling the `mode` method in the companion object, which extracts the `ModePeerFeature` from the peer's `peerSpec` if it exists.

3. What is the purpose of the `jsonEncoder` implicit in the `ErgoPeerStatus` companion object?
- The `jsonEncoder` implicit is used to encode an `ErgoPeerStatus` object as JSON. It includes fields for the peer's address, version, mode, status, and height.
