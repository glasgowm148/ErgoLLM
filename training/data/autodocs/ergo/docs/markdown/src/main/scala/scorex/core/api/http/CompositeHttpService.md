The `CompositeHttpService` class is a part of the `ergo` project and is responsible for creating a composite HTTP service that combines multiple routes into a single route. This class takes in an `ActorSystem`, a sequence of `ApiRoute`s, a `RESTApiSettings` object, and a `swaggerConf` string as input parameters.

The `routes` parameter is a sequence of `ApiRoute`s that define the various routes that will be combined into the composite route. The `settings` parameter is a `RESTApiSettings` object that contains various settings related to the REST API. The `swaggerConf` parameter is a string that contains the configuration for the Swagger UI.

The `CompositeHttpService` class extends the `CorsHandler` trait, which provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support for the HTTP service.

The `swaggerService` value is an instance of the `SwaggerConfigRoute` class, which is responsible for serving the Swagger UI configuration. The `redirectToSwagger` value is a route that redirects the user to the Swagger UI page when they access the root URL or the `/` path.

The `compositeRoute` value is the composite route that combines all the routes defined in the `routes` parameter, the Swagger UI configuration route, and the redirect route. The `reduceOption` method is used to combine the routes using the `~` operator, which creates a new route that matches both routes. If the `routes` sequence is empty, the `RouteDirectives.reject` method is used to create a route that always rejects the request.

Overall, the `CompositeHttpService` class provides a convenient way to combine multiple routes into a single route and serve them as a composite HTTP service. This class can be used in the larger `ergo` project to provide a unified API for various components of the system. For example, different modules of the system can define their own routes and then combine them using the `CompositeHttpService` class to create a single API endpoint for the entire system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeHttpService` class?
- The `CompositeHttpService` class is responsible for combining multiple `ApiRoute` instances into a single `Route` and adding Swagger documentation to the API.

2. What is the `CorsHandler` trait and how is it used in this code?
- The `CorsHandler` trait is a mixin that provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support to the `CompositeHttpService`. It is used to handle HTTP requests that originate from a different domain than the API.

3. What is the purpose of the `redirectToSwagger` value?
- The `redirectToSwagger` value is a `Route` that redirects any requests to the root path or `/swagger` path to the Swagger documentation page. This is done using a `PermanentRedirect` status code.
