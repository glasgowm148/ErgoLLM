The `ErgoWalletState` class is a key component of the Ergo platform's wallet functionality. It represents the current state of the wallet, including its storage, registry, and various readers. The class contains several methods that allow the wallet to interact with the blockchain, including reading boxes from the UTXO set, selecting boxes to spend, and determining the expected height of the next block.

One of the most important methods in the class is `walletFilter`, which is used to select boxes that are on-chain and not spent off-chain yet or created off-chain. This filter is used when the wallet is going through its boxes to assemble a transaction. The `walletFilter` method takes a `TrackedBox` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the box should be included in the transaction. The method checks whether the box is on-chain and not spent off-chain yet or created off-chain, and whether it is not already spent by inputs of mempool transactions.

The `ErgoWalletState` class also contains several helper methods, such as `getChangeAddress`, which returns the change address for the wallet, and `readBoxFromUtxoWithWalletFallback`, which reads a box from the UTXO set if the node has it, otherwise from the wallet.

The `ErgoWalletState` object contains a `initial` method that initializes a new `ErgoWalletState` instance with the given `ErgoSettings` and `Parameters`. The method creates a new `WalletRegistry`, `WalletStorage`, and `OffChainRegistry`, and initializes the `WalletVars` with the given `ErgoSettings`. The `maxInputsToUse` parameter specifies the maximum number of inputs to use when selecting boxes to spend.

Overall, the `ErgoWalletState` class is a critical component of the Ergo platform's wallet functionality, providing methods for selecting boxes to spend, reading boxes from the UTXO set, and determining the expected height of the next block.
