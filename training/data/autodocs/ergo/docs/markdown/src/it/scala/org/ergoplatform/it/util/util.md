The code defines two implicit classes and their methods that can be used in the larger ergo project. The first implicit class is `TimerExt` which extends the `io.netty.util.Timer` class. It defines a method `schedule` that takes a function `f` that returns a `Future[A]` and a `delay` of type `FiniteDuration`. The method schedules the execution of the function `f` after the specified `delay` duration. It creates a new `Promise[A]` and completes it with the result of the function `f` when the timer expires. If there is an exception thrown during the execution of the function `f`, the `Promise` is failed with the exception. The method returns the `Future[A]` associated with the `Promise`.

The second implicit class is `RichEither` which extends the `Either[String, A]` class. It defines two methods `toFuture` and `get`. The `toFuture` method converts the `Either` to a `Future[A]`. If the `Either` is a `Left` with a `String` error message, it is converted to a `Try` with a new `Exception` and then to a `Future` with `Future.fromTry`. If the `Either` is a `Right` with a value of type `A`, it is converted to a `Future` with `Future.successful`. The `get` method returns the value of type `A` if the `Either` is a `Right`. If the `Either` is a `Left`, it throws a new `Exception` with the error message.

These implicit classes and their methods can be used in the ergo project to simplify the scheduling of tasks and error handling. For example, the `schedule` method can be used to schedule the execution of a function after a certain delay. The `retryUntil` method can be used to retry the execution of a function until a certain condition is met. The `toFuture` method can be used to convert an `Either` to a `Future` for easier error handling. The `get` method can be used to extract the value of type `A` from a `Right` `Either`. Overall, these methods provide useful abstractions for common tasks in the ergo project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TimerExt` class and its `schedule` method?
   - The `TimerExt` class provides an extension method for the `Timer` class that schedules a future to be completed after a specified delay.
2. What is the purpose of the `retryUntil` method?
   - The `retryUntil` method takes a future and a condition, and retries the future until the condition is met, with a specified interval between retries.
3. What is the purpose of the `RichEither` class and its `toFuture` and `get` methods?
   - The `RichEither` class provides extension methods for the `Either` class to convert it to a future or extract its value, throwing an exception if it is a left value.
