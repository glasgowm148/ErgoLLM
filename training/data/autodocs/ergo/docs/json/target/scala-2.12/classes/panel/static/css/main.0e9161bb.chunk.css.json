  "summary": "This code is responsible for styling the user interface of the Ergo project. It imports various SCSS files, such as `_normalize.scss`, `_fonts.scss`, `variables`, `button`, and `infoModal`, which contain styles for different components and utilities used throughout the project. The code also includes a set of styles for the `html`, `body`, `ul`, `a`, and other elements to ensure consistent appearance across different browsers.\n\nThe `Backdrop.module.scss` file contains styles for a backdrop component, which is used to create a fixed, full-screen overlay with a content area and a semi-transparent background layer. This can be useful for displaying modal dialogs or other content that should appear above the rest of the page.\n\nThe `_fonts.scss` file defines the `@font-face` rules for the 'Roboto' and 'Material Icons' font families, which are used throughout the project. The `button` component styles define various button sizes and states, such as primary, secondary, and close buttons. The `infoModal` component styles define the appearance of an info modal dialog, including the layout, content, and buttons.\n\nThe `utils.scss` file contains a utility function `rem` that converts pixel values to rem units, which are relative to the base font size. This helps maintain consistent sizing and spacing throughout the project.\n\nOverall, this code ensures a consistent and polished appearance for the Ergo project's user interface, making it easier to build and maintain the project's components.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n\n   This code is a combination of CSS styles for a project called \"ergo\". It includes styles for various components, such as buttons and modals, as well as general styles for elements like headings, lists, and links. It also imports some external stylesheets, like normalize.css and custom font styles.\n\n2. **What are the imported stylesheets used for?**\n\n   The imported stylesheets serve different purposes:\n   - `_normalize.scss` is used to reset and normalize default browser styles for a consistent appearance across different browsers.\n   - `_fonts.scss` contains font-face declarations for custom fonts used in the project.\n   - `variables` is likely a file containing Sass variables for colors, font sizes, and other reusable values.\n   - `components/button.scss` and `components/infoModal.scss` contain styles specific to button and modal components in the project.\n   - `utils.scss` probably contains utility classes and functions for the project.\n\n3. **How are the styles organized in this code?**\n\n   The styles are organized into different sections, such as general styles for elements (e.g., headings, lists, links), component-specific styles (e.g., buttons, modals), and imported stylesheets. The code also includes media queries for responsive design, adjusting styles based on the screen size."
