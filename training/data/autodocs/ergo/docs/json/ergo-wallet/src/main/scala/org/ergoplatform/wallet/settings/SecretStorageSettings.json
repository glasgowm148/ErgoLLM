  "summary": "The `SecretStorageSettings` class is a case class that contains two properties: `secretDir` and `encryption`. This class is a part of the `org.ergoplatform.wallet.settings` package and is used to store settings related to secret storage in the Ergo platform wallet.\n\nThe `secretDir` property is a string that represents the directory where the secrets will be stored. This directory is specified by the user and can be any valid directory path on the system.\n\nThe `encryption` property is an instance of the `EncryptionSettings` class, which contains settings related to encryption of the secrets. This class is not defined in this file, but it is likely that it contains properties such as the encryption algorithm to be used, the key size, and other related settings.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to store and retrieve secrets securely. For example, if the Ergo platform wallet needs to store the user's private key, it can use an instance of this class to specify the directory where the private key will be stored and the encryption settings to be used to encrypt the private key.\n\nHere is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nval secretDir = \"/path/to/secret/dir\"\nval encryptionSettings = EncryptionSettings(\"AES\", 256)\nval secretStorageSettings = SecretStorageSettings(secretDir, encryptionSettings)\n\n// Use the secretStorageSettings instance to store and retrieve secrets securely\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SecretStorageSettings` class?\n   - The `SecretStorageSettings` class is used to store settings related to secret storage, such as the directory where secrets are stored and encryption settings.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `final` keyword before the `case class` declaration?\n   - The `final` keyword indicates that the `SecretStorageSettings` class cannot be subclassed or extended.\n\n3. What is the `EncryptionSettings` class and how is it used in conjunction with `SecretStorageSettings`?\n   - The `EncryptionSettings` class is likely another class used to store settings related to encryption. It is used as a parameter in the `SecretStorageSettings` constructor to specify the encryption settings to be used for secret storage."
