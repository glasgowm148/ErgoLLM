  "summary": "The `WalletScanLogic` object contains functions that scan boxes, transactions, and blocks to find boxes that belong to a wallet's keys. The high-level purpose of this code is to update the wallet database by scanning and processing block transactions. \n\nThe `scanBlockTransactions` function takes in a `WalletRegistry`, `OffChainRegistry`, `WalletVars`, `ErgoFullBlock`, `cachedOutputsFilter`, `dustLimit`, and `WalletProfile`. It scans and processes the block transactions, updates the wallet database, and returns the updated wallet database, off-chain snapshot, and the Bloom filter for wallet outputs. \n\nThe `extractWalletOutputs` function extracts all outputs that contain tracked bytes from the given transaction. It takes in an `ErgoTransaction`, `inclusionHeight`, `WalletVars`, and `dustLimit`. It returns a sequence of `TrackedBox` objects that represent the extracted outputs. \n\nThe `extractInputBoxes` function extracts all input boxes from the given transaction. It takes in an `ErgoTransaction` and returns a sequence of `EncodedBoxId` objects that represent the extracted input boxes. \n\nOverall, this code is an essential part of the `ergo` project's wallet functionality. It allows the wallet to keep track of its state by scanning and processing block transactions. The `WalletScanLogic` object provides functions that extract relevant information from transactions and update the wallet database accordingly.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletScanLogic` object?\n- `WalletScanLogic` contains functions that scan boxes, transactions, and blocks to find boxes that belong to a wallet's keys.\n\n2. What is the `scanBlockTransactions` function used for?\n- `scanBlockTransactions` updates the wallet database by scanning and processing block transactions. It takes in a versioned wallet database, an in-memory snapshot of the current state, the current wallet state, block height, block id, block transactions, a Bloom filter for previously created outputs, and a dust limit. It returns an updated wallet database, offchain snapshot, and the Bloom filter for wallet outputs.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `extractWalletOutputs` function?\n- `extractWalletOutputs` extracts all outputs that contain tracked bytes from a given transaction. It takes in a transaction, inclusion height, wallet variables, and a dust limit. It returns a sequence of tracked boxes."
