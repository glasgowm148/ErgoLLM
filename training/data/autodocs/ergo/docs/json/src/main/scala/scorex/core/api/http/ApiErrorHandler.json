  "summary": "The `ApiErrorHandler` object in the `scorex.core.api.http` package is responsible for handling exceptions that may occur during the execution of the API. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized way of handling exceptions that may occur in the API, making it easier to manage and debug errors.\n\nThe `ApiErrorHandler` object defines an implicit `ExceptionHandler` that takes a `NonFatal` exception and returns an `ApiError`. The `NonFatal` exception is a superclass of all exceptions that are not fatal, meaning that they can be caught and handled. The `ApiError` is a custom error class that is defined elsewhere in the project.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project by simply importing the `ApiErrorHandler` object and using the implicit `ExceptionHandler` defined within it. For example, if an exception occurs in an API endpoint, the `ExceptionHandler` will catch it and return an `ApiError` instead of crashing the application. This makes it easier to manage errors and provide a better user experience.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```scala\nimport scorex.core.api.http.ApiErrorHandler.exceptionHandler\n\nval route = path(\"example\") {\n  // API endpoint code that may throw an exception\n}\n\n// Use the implicit exception handler defined in ApiErrorHandler\nval handledRoute = handleExceptions(exceptionHandler)(route)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `handleExceptions` directive is used to wrap the API endpoint code with the `exceptionHandler` defined in `ApiErrorHandler`. If an exception occurs in the endpoint code, the `exceptionHandler` will catch it and return an `ApiError`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ApiErrorHandler` object?\n   - The `ApiErrorHandler` object provides an implicit `ExceptionHandler` that handles non-fatal exceptions by returning an `ApiError`.\n\n2. What is the `ApiError` class and where is it defined?\n   - The code snippet does not provide information on the `ApiError` class or its definition. It is possible that it is defined in another file within the `ergo` project.\n\n3. How is the `exceptionHandler` used in the project?\n   - The `exceptionHandler` is an implicit value that can be used by other parts of the project to handle non-fatal exceptions. It is likely that it is used in conjunction with the Akka HTTP server to handle exceptions that occur during HTTP requests."
