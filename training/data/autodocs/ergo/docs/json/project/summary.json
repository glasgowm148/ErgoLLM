      "summary": "The code defines a custom merge strategy for use in the ergo project. Specifically, it provides a merge strategy suitable for merging configuration files. \n\nThe `CustomMergeStrategy` object defines a single `val` named `concatReversed`, which is an instance of the `MergeStrategy` trait. This trait defines a single method, `apply`, which takes a temporary directory, a path, and a sequence of files, and returns either an error message or a sequence of pairs of files and paths. \n\nThe `concatReversed` merge strategy works by concatenating the contents of the input files in reverse order, and writing the result to a new file in the temporary directory. The resulting file is then returned as a pair with the original path. The `IO.transfer` method is used to copy the contents of each input file to the output file, and the `IO.read` method is used to check if the last character of the input file is a newline character. If not, a newline character is added to the output file. \n\nThis merge strategy is designed to be used with the `sbtassembly` plugin, which is used to create a single, executable JAR file from multiple project dependencies. The `sbtassembly` plugin allows users to specify custom merge strategies for handling conflicts between files with the same path. By using the `concatReversed` merge strategy, the ergo project can ensure that configuration files are merged in a consistent and predictable manner. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport sbtassembly.AssemblyPlugin.autoImport._\n\n// Add the custom merge strategy to the assembly merge strategy list\nassemblyMergeStrategy in assembly := {\n  case \"path/to/config/file\" => CustomMergeStrategy.concatReversed\n  case x => MergeStrategy.defaultMergeStrategy(x)\n}\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a custom merge strategy for sbt assembly that concatenates files in reverse order.\n\n2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?\n   - The `apply` method takes a temporary directory, a path, and a sequence of files as input, and returns either an error message or a sequence of tuples containing a merged file and its path.\n\n3. How is the custom merge strategy implemented?\n   - The `concatReversed` merge strategy is implemented as a new instance of the `MergeStrategy` trait, which overrides the `apply` method to concatenate files in reverse order and add a newline character between them."

For all other files, the default merge strategy is used. This ensures that the custom merge strategy is only applied to the desired configuration files, while the rest of the project files are handled using the default strategy.",
