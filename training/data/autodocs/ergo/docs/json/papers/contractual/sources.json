  "summary": "This code consists of a collection of bibliographic references related to the Ergo project, a resilient platform for contractual money. The references cover various topics such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, smart contracts, and alternative currency systems.\n\nFor example, the reference `pascalCoin` points to the white paper of Pascal Coin, a cryptocurrency that aims to provide a scalable and easy-to-use platform for transactions. Similarly, the reference `eth2016dos` discusses a denial-of-service attack on the Ethereum network, which is a well-known platform for creating decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe code also includes references to research papers that analyze different aspects of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The paper `atzei2017survey` presents a survey of attacks on Ethereum smart contracts, while `rivest2001leak` discusses methods for leaking secrets in cryptographic systems.\n\nAdditionally, the code contains references to articles and blog posts that explore the use of Ergo for creating local exchange trading systems (LETS). The articles `lets-trusted` and `lets-trustless` describe the development of trustless and trusted LETS on top of Ergo, respectively.\n\nOverall, these references provide a comprehensive overview of the research and development efforts related to the Ergo project and its underlying technologies. They can be used as a starting point for further research and development in the field of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and alternative currency systems.",
