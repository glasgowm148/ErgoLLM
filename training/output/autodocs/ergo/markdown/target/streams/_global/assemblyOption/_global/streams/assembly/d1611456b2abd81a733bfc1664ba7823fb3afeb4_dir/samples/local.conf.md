This code is a configuration file for the ergo project. It allows the user to customize various settings related to the node and wallet functionality, as well as the network and REST API. 

The `ergo` block contains settings related to the node, such as the state type (either "utxo" or "digest"), whether the node is doing mining, and whether to use an external miner. It also allows the user to specify a public key for mining rewards. The `wallet` block contains settings related to the wallet, such as the language to be used in the mnemonic seed and whether to keep spent boxes or delete them immediately. 

The `scorex` block contains settings related to the network and REST API. The `network` block allows the user to specify a node name to send during handshake, a list of well-known nodes, and the network address to bind to. The `restApi` block allows the user to specify the network address to bind to and an API key hash for authentication purposes. 

Overall, this configuration file allows the user to customize various aspects of the ergo project to suit their needs. For example, they can choose whether to use an external miner, which language to use in the mnemonic seed, and which network address to bind to for the REST API. 

Example usage:

To specify that the node should use the "digest" state type and the wallet should keep spent boxes, the user can uncomment the following lines:

```
# stateType = "digest"
# keepSpentBoxes = true
``` 

To specify a node name and a list of well-known nodes, the user can uncomment the following lines and fill in the appropriate values:

```
# nodeName = "my-node"
# knownPeers = ["IP1:port1", "IP2:port2"]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains settings for the Ergo blockchain node and wallet, as well as the Scorex network and REST API.

2. What are some of the configurable options for the Ergo node and wallet?
- The node can be set to keep a full utxo set or just the state root hash, and can be configured for mining and external miners. The wallet can be set to use different languages for the mnemonic seed and to keep spent boxes or delete them immediately.

3. What are some of the configurable options for the Scorex network and REST API?
- The network can be configured with a node name and a list of well-known peers, as well as a bind address. The REST API can be configured with a bind address and an API key hash.
