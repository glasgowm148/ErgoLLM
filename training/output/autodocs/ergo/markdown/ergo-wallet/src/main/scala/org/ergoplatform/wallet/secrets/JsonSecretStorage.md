The `JsonSecretStorage` class is a secret storage backend for the Ergo wallet project. It is responsible for managing access to secrets and storing encrypted seeds in a JSON file. The structure of the JSON file is described by the `EncryptedSecret` class. The `JsonSecretStorage` class implements the `SecretStorage` trait, which defines the interface for managing secrets. 

The `JsonSecretStorage` class has a constructor that takes a `File` object and an `EncryptionSettings` object. The `File` object represents the JSON file where the encrypted seed is stored, and the `EncryptionSettings` object contains the encryption settings used to encrypt and decrypt the seed. The class has a private variable `unlockedSecret` that stores the unlocked secret. The `isLocked` method returns `true` if the `unlockedSecret` variable is empty, indicating that the secrets are locked. The `secret` method returns the `unlockedSecret` variable if it is not empty, indicating that the secrets are unlocked.

The `checkSeed` method checks if the seed can be decrypted using the provided mnemonic and optional password. It returns `true` if the seed can be decrypted and matches the `unlockedSecret` variable.

The `unlock` method decrypts the seed using the provided password and makes the secrets available through the `secret` method. It returns a `Try[Unit]` object that contains either a `Success` object if the seed was successfully decrypted, or a `Failure` object if an error occurred.

The `lock` method destroys all loaded secrets by calling the `zeroSecret` method on the `ExtendedSecretKey` object and setting the `unlockedSecret` variable to `None`.

The `JsonSecretStorage` object contains methods for initializing the storage instance with a new wallet file encrypted with the given password, initializing the storage with the seed derived from an existing mnemonic phrase, and reading the JSON file. 

Here is an example of how to use the `JsonSecretStorage` class:

```scala
import org.ergoplatform.wallet.secrets._

val secretFile = new File("path/to/secret/file.json")
val encryptionSettings = EncryptionSettings("algorithm", "mode", "padding", "keySize")
val secretStorage = new JsonSecretStorage(secretFile, encryptionSettings)

val mnemonic = SecretString("mnemonic")
val password = SecretString("password")
val usePre1627KeyDerivation = true
val seed = Mnemonic.toSeed(mnemonic, None)
val newSecretStorage = JsonSecretStorage.init(seed, password, usePre1627KeyDerivation)(SecretStorageSettings("dir", encryptionSettings))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a secret storage backend for managing access to secrets. It stores encrypted seed in a json file and is responsible for unlocking and locking secrets.
2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries including io.circe, org.ergoplatform.wallet.crypto, org.ergoplatform.wallet.mnemonic, org.ergoplatform.wallet.interface4j, and scorex.util.encode.
3. What is the encryption method used in this code and how is it implemented?
- This code uses AES encryption to encrypt and decrypt the seed. The `crypto.AES.encrypt` method is used to encrypt the seed and the `crypto.AES.decrypt` method is used to decrypt the seed. The encryption and decryption methods take in the password, salt, iv, and tag as parameters.
