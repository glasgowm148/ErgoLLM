The `TransactionHintsBag` class is a data structure that holds hints for a transaction. Hints are additional information that can be used to optimize the verification of a transaction. The class has two fields: `secretHints` and `publicHints`, which are maps that associate input indices with hints bags. A hints bag is a collection of hints that can be either public or secret. Public hints are those that can be safely revealed to anyone, while secret hints are those that should be kept private.

The class provides three methods to manipulate the hints bags. The `replaceHintsForInput` method replaces the hints bag for a given input index with a new one. The `addHintsForInput` method adds new hints to the hints bag for a given input index. The `allHintsForInput` method returns the combined hints bag for a given input index.

The `TransactionHintsBag` object provides a factory method to create a new instance of the class from a map of mixed hints bags. The mixed hints bags map associates input indices with hints bags that can contain both public and secret hints. The factory method creates a new instance of `TransactionHintsBag` by replacing the hints bags for each input index with a new hints bag that contains only the hints of the corresponding type (public or secret).

This class is used in the larger project to optimize the verification of transactions. By providing additional information in the form of hints, the verification process can be made more efficient. The hints can be generated by the wallet or by other components of the system. For example, a component that performs coin selection can use hints to select coins that are more likely to be spent in the transaction. The hints can also be used to optimize the verification of complex scripts that are used to lock the coins. By providing additional information about the structure of the script, the verification process can be made more efficient. 

Example usage:

```scala
val hintsBag = HintsBag(Seq(publicHint1, secretHint1))
val transactionHintsBag = TransactionHintsBag(Map(0 -> hintsBag))
val updatedHintsBag = transactionHintsBag.addHintsForInput(0, HintsBag(Seq(publicHint2)))
val allHints = updatedHintsBag.allHintsForInput(0)
``` 

In this example, a new hints bag is created with one public hint and one secret hint. Then, a new `TransactionHintsBag` instance is created with the hints bag associated with input index 0. The `addHintsForInput` method is called to add a new public hint to the hints bag for input index 0. Finally, the `allHintsForInput` method is called to retrieve the combined hints bag for input index 0.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionHintsBag` class?
- The `TransactionHintsBag` class is used to store and manage hints for transaction inputs.

2. What is the difference between `replaceHintsForInput` and `addHintsForInput` methods?
- The `replaceHintsForInput` method replaces the hints for a transaction input with the provided hints, while the `addHintsForInput` method adds the provided hints to the existing hints for the transaction input.

3. What is the purpose of the `allHintsForInput` method?
- The `allHintsForInput` method returns both public and secret hints for a given transaction input index.
