The code in this folder is related to the implementation of an authenticated AVL+ tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree that provides proofs of membership or non-membership for any key in the tree. The folder contains three main files: `NodeParameters.scala`, `ProxyInternalProverNode.scala`, and `VersionedLDBAVLStorage.scala`.

`NodeParameters.scala` defines a case class called `NodeParameters` that represents the parameters of AVL+ tree nodes, both internal and leaves. This class is used to customize the AVL+ tree to fit the specific needs of the project, making it a useful tool for efficient data storage and retrieval. For example, if the project requires keys of a certain size, the `keySize` parameter can be set accordingly.

`ProxyInternalProverNode.scala` represents an internal node of an AVL tree, allowing for lazy loading of a tree by not constructing children nodes during node construction, but only providing pointers to them. This allows for efficient memory usage and faster tree construction. An example of using this class in the larger project could be constructing an AVL tree of transactions in a blockchain, where the tree is constructed lazily to save memory and improve performance.

`VersionedLDBAVLStorage.scala` is a persistent implementation of an authenticated AVL+ tree on top of versioned LevelDB storage. The class provides methods to update the tree, rollback to a previous version of the tree, and get the current version of the tree. This implementation can be used in the larger project to store and manage data in an efficient and secure manner.

Here's an example of how these classes might be used together:

```scala
import scorex.crypto.authds.avltree.batch._

// Define node parameters
val nodeParameters = NodeParameters(keySize = 32, valueSize = Some(64), labelSize = 32)

// Create a LevelDB storage
val store = new LDBVersionedStore("path/to/leveldb")

// Create a versioned AVL storage
val avlStorage = new VersionedLDBAVLStorage(store, nodeParameters, hashFunction)

// Create a BatchAVLProver
val prover = new BatchAVLProver(nodeParameters, Some(avlStorage))

// Insert a key-value pair
val key = ADKey("key")
val value = ADValue("value")
prover.performOneOperation(Insert(key, value))

// Update the AVL storage with the changes made by the prover
avlStorage.update(prover, Seq())

// Get the current version of the tree
val currentVersion = avlStorage.version

// Rollback the tree to a previous version
avlStorage.rollback(previousVersion)
```

Overall, the code in this folder provides a foundation for implementing an authenticated AVL+ tree in the larger project, which can be used for efficient storage and retrieval of data, as well as providing proofs of membership or non-membership for any key in the tree.
