The code above defines a trait called `ActorHelper` that provides a helper method for interacting with Akka actors. Specifically, the `askActor` method encapsulates the ask pattern for actors and returns a `Future` of the specified type `A`. 

The `askActor` method takes in three parameters: an `ActorRef` representing the actor to send the message to, a `question` of any type representing the message to send, and an implicit `Timeout` representing the maximum amount of time to wait for a response. The method uses the `?` operator to send the message to the actor and returns a `Future` that will be completed with the response from the actor.

This trait can be used in the larger project to simplify interactions with Akka actors. For example, if there is an actor that is responsible for handling user authentication, the `askActor` method can be used to send a message to the actor and receive a `Future` of the authentication result. This can simplify the code needed to interact with the actor and make it easier to handle asynchronous responses.

Here is an example usage of the `askActor` method:

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorRef
import akka.util.Timeout
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.duration._

class UserAuthenticator(authActor: ActorRef) extends ActorHelper {
  implicit val timeout: Timeout = Timeout(5.seconds)

  def authenticate(username: String, password: String): Future[Boolean] = {
    val authRequest = AuthRequest(username, password)
    askActor[Boolean](authActor, authRequest)
  }
}

case class AuthRequest(username: String, password: String)
```

In this example, `UserAuthenticator` is a class that uses the `ActorHelper` trait to interact with an authentication actor. The `authenticate` method takes in a username and password, creates an `AuthRequest` message, and sends it to the authentication actor using the `askActor` method. The method returns a `Future[Boolean]` that will be completed with the authentication result. 

Overall, the `ActorHelper` trait provides a useful abstraction for interacting with Akka actors and can simplify asynchronous interactions in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ActorHelper` trait?
   - The `ActorHelper` trait encapsulates the ask pattern for actors and returns a `Future[_]`.

2. What does the `askActor` method do?
   - The `askActor` method sends a message (`question`) to an actor (`actorRef`) and returns a `Future` of the expected response type (`A`).

3. What dependencies does this code require?
   - This code requires the `akka.actor.ActorRef`, `akka.pattern.ask`, `akka.util.Timeout`, `scala.concurrent.Future`, and `scala.reflect.ClassTag` dependencies.
