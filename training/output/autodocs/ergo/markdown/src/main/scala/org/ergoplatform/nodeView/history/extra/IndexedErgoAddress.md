The `IndexedErgoAddress` class in this code represents an index of an Ergo address (ErgoTree) and its associated transactions and boxes. It is used to efficiently query and manipulate the transaction and box data related to a specific address. The class contains methods for adding and spending boxes, retrieving transactions and boxes, and rolling back the state of the address.

The `IndexedErgoAddress` class has the following main properties:

- `treeHash`: The hash of the corresponding ErgoTree.
- `txs`: A list of numeric transaction indexes associated with this address.
- `boxes`: A list of numeric box indexes associated with this address. Negative values indicate the box is spent.
- `balanceInfo`: Balance information (Optional because fragments do not contain it).

The class provides methods to:

- Retrieve a range of transactions associated with the address (`retrieveTxs`).
- Retrieve a range of boxes associated with the address (`retrieveBoxes`).
- Retrieve a range of unspent boxes associated with the address (`retrieveUtxos`).
- Add a transaction index to the address (`addTx`).
- Add a box to the address and update the balance information (`addBox`).
- Spend a box associated with the address and update the balance information (`spendBox`).
- Rollback the state of the address and associated boxes (`rollback`).
- Split the address into segments containing a specific number of transaction and box indexes (`splitToSegments`).

The `IndexedErgoAddressSerializer` object provides methods to serialize and deserialize `IndexedErgoAddress` instances. It also provides utility functions to compute the Blake2b hash of a given ErgoTree (`hashErgoTree`), calculate the id of an address segment containing box indexes (`boxSegmentId`), and calculate the id of an address segment containing transaction indexes (`txSegmentId`).

This code is useful in the larger project for efficiently managing and querying address-related data, such as transactions and boxes, and for performing operations like adding and spending boxes, and rolling back the state of an address.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `IndexedErgoAddress` class?**

   The `IndexedErgoAddress` class represents an index of an address (ErgoTree) and contains the hash of the corresponding ErgoTree, a list of numeric transaction indexes associated with the address, a list of numeric box indexes associated with the address, and balance information.

2. **How does the `rollback` method work in the `IndexedErgoAddress` class?**

   The `rollback` method is used to revert the state of the address and its associated boxes to a previous state by removing transaction numbers above a specified target, removing box numbers above a specified target, and reverting the balance. It takes `txTarget`, `boxTarget`, and `_history` as parameters and updates the address in the database accordingly.

3. **What is the purpose of the `splitToSegments` method in the `IndexedErgoAddress` class?**

   The `splitToSegments` method is used to create an array of addresses, each containing a "segmentTreshold" number of the address's transaction and box indexes. These special addresses have their ids calculated by "txSegmentId" and "boxSegmentId" respectively. This method helps in organizing and managing the transaction and box indexes associated with an address.
