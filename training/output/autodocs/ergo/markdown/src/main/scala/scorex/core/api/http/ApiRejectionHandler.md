The `ApiRejectionHandler` object in the `scorex.core.api.http` package is responsible for handling HTTP rejections in the Ergo project. When a request is made to the Ergo API, it may be rejected for various reasons, such as invalid authentication, missing query parameters, or unsupported URI schemes. The `ApiRejectionHandler` object defines how these rejections should be handled and what error messages should be returned to the client.

The `ApiRejectionHandler` object defines an implicit `RejectionHandler` that is used by the Akka HTTP server to handle rejections. The `RejectionHandler` is built using a series of `handle` and `handleAll` directives that match specific types of rejections and define how they should be handled. For example, the `handleAll[SchemeRejection]` directive matches all `SchemeRejection` rejections and returns a `BadRequest` error message that lists the supported URI schemes. Similarly, the `handle { case AuthorizationFailedRejection => ... }` directive matches `AuthorizationFailedRejection` rejections and returns a `Forbidden` error message indicating that the authentication is not authorized to access the requested resource.

The `ApiRejectionHandler` object also defines a `handleNotFound` directive that matches requests that could not be handled by any of the previous directives. This directive returns a `BadRequest` error message indicating that the requested resource or endpoint could not be found.

Overall, the `ApiRejectionHandler` object plays an important role in ensuring that clients receive informative error messages when their requests are rejected by the Ergo API. By defining how different types of rejections should be handled, the `ApiRejectionHandler` object helps to make the Ergo API more user-friendly and easier to debug. 

Example usage:

```scala
import akka.http.scaladsl.server._
import scorex.core.api.http.ApiRejectionHandler

val rejectionHandler: RejectionHandler = ApiRejectionHandler.rejectionHandler

// Use the rejection handler in an Akka HTTP route
val route: Route = path("example") {
  get {
    // Perform some action that may result in a rejection
    complete("Example response")
  }
}.handleRejections(rejectionHandler)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an implicit `RejectionHandler` object for handling HTTP request rejections in the `scorex.core.api.http` package.

2. What types of rejections does this code handle?
- This code handles several types of rejections, including `SchemeRejection`, `AuthorizationFailedRejection`, `MalformedRequestContentRejection`, `InvalidOriginRejection`, `MissingQueryParamRejection`, `RequestEntityExpectedRejection`, and `ValidationRejection`.

3. What is the expected behavior when a rejection is handled?
- When a rejection is handled, the code returns an `ApiError` object with an appropriate error message based on the type of rejection. If the rejection is not one of the handled types, the code returns an `ApiError` object with an "InternalError" message. If the requested resource or endpoint is not found, the code returns a "BadRequest" error message.
