The `ErgoNodeViewHolder` is a central component of the Ergo node that manages the local view of the blockchain. It is responsible for maintaining and updating the history, state, wallet, and memory pool instances. The class provides methods for processing new modifiers, transactions, and locally generated modifiers, as well as handling requests for the current view and node view changes.

When a new modifier is received, it is first checked if it is already in the history. If not, the modifier is appended to the history and applied to the state. The state is then updated, and the memory pool and wallet are updated accordingly. If the modifier is a block section generated locally, it is directly dumped into the database.

For transaction processing, the class provides methods for handling transactions from remote peers, locally generated transactions, and rechecked transactions. The memory pool is updated accordingly based on the transaction processing outcome.

The `restoreState` method is used to restore the local view during node startup. If no stored view is found, the `genesisState` method is used to create a hard-coded initial view. The `restoreConsistentState` method is used to ensure that the state and history are consistent during recovery.

The class also provides methods for handling health checks, which periodically check if the chain is healthy or stuck. If the chain is stuck, a `ChainIsStuck` event is published with details about the issue.

Overall, the `ErgoNodeViewHolder` plays a crucial role in managing the local view of the blockchain and ensuring its consistency and integrity.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `ErgoNodeViewHolder` class?**

   The `ErgoNodeViewHolder` class represents a composite local view of the node, containing instances for History, ErgoState, Vault, and MemoryPool. It is responsible for updating these instances atomically and handling various messages related to modifiers, transactions, and node view changes.

2. **How does the `ErgoNodeViewHolder` handle remote and local persistent modifiers?**

   The `ErgoNodeViewHolder` processes remote and local persistent modifiers by appending them to history, applying them to the state, and propagating the changes to the mempool and wallet. It also handles cases where the state and history are inconsistent and need to be recovered.

3. **How does the `ErgoNodeViewHolder` update the mempool after a block application?**

   The `ErgoNodeViewHolder` updates the mempool by removing transactions included in the applied block and returning transactions from the rolled back block to the pool. It also handles cases where the blockchain is synced and cleans the mempool from transactions that may have become invalid.
