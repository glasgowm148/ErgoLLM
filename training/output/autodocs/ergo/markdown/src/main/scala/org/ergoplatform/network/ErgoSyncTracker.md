The `ErgoSyncTracker` class is responsible for keeping track of the synchronization status of peers in the Ergo network. It provides data structures and methods to manage the status of peers, find peers with expired status to send sync messages, and update the status of peers based on the sync information received from them.

The class has a constructor that takes a `NetworkSettings` object as input. It also defines several private constants for managing the synchronization process, such as `MinSyncInterval`, `SyncThreshold`, and `ClearThreshold`.

The `ErgoSyncTracker` class maintains a mutable map called `statuses` that maps `ConnectedPeer` objects to `ErgoPeerStatus` objects. The `ErgoPeerStatus` class contains information about the synchronization status of a peer, such as its status, height, and last sync time.

The class provides several methods for managing the synchronization status of peers. The `updateLastSyncGetTime` method updates the last sync time of a peer and returns the time difference between the current time and the previous sync time. The `notSyncedOrOutdated` method checks if a sync message was sent long ago to a peer or not sent at all yet. The `updateStatus` method updates the synchronization status of a peer based on the sync information received from it. It also returns a tuple containing the new peer status and a boolean indicating whether our node should send a sync message to the peer. The `updateLastSyncSentTime` method updates the last sync time of a peer after sending a sync message to it.

The `ErgoSyncTracker` class also provides several helper methods for managing the synchronization status of peers. The `clearStatus` method clears the status of a peer. The `clearOldStatuses` method clears the status of peers that have not been updated for a long time. The `outdatedPeers` method returns a list of peers that have not been updated for a long time. The `peersToSyncWith` method returns a list of peers to which our node should send a sync signal. It includes outdated peers, if any, otherwise, all the peers with an unknown status plus a random peer with an `Older` status.

The `ErgoSyncTracker` class is an essential component of the Ergo network. It provides the necessary functionality to manage the synchronization status of peers and ensure that the network is operating correctly. Developers can use this class to build more complex synchronization logic on top of it. For example, they can use it to implement a custom synchronization strategy that takes into account the network topology, latency, and other factors.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoSyncTracker` class?
- The `ErgoSyncTracker` class is responsible for keeping track of the synchronization status of peers, finding peers with expired status to send sync messages, and updating the status of peers based on received sync messages.

2. What are the meanings of the `MinSyncInterval`, `SyncThreshold`, and `ClearThreshold` variables?
- `MinSyncInterval` is the minimum amount of time that must pass before sending another sync message to a peer.
- `SyncThreshold` is the maximum amount of time that can pass before a sync message is considered outdated and a new one should be sent.
- `ClearThreshold` is the amount of time that must pass before a peer's status is cleared if it has not been updated.

3. What is the purpose of the `peersToSyncWith` method?
- The `peersToSyncWith` method returns the peers to which this node should send a sync signal, including outdated peers if any, otherwise all the peers with unknown status plus a random peer with `Older` status. It also updates the `lastSyncSentTime` for all returned peers as a side effect.
