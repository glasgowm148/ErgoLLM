The `ErgoHttpService` class is responsible for defining the HTTP service for the Ergo platform. It takes in three parameters: `apiRoutes`, `swaggerRoute`, and `panelRoute`, which are all routes that are defined elsewhere in the codebase. The `ErgoHttpService` class extends the `CorsHandler` trait, which is used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests.

The `rejectionHandler` and `exceptionHandler` methods define how the server should handle rejections and exceptions, respectively. They both use pre-defined handlers from the `ApiRejectionHandler` and `ApiErrorHandler` classes.

The `compositeRoute` method defines the main route for the HTTP service. It uses the `handleRejections`, `handleExceptions`, and `corsHandler` directives to handle rejections, exceptions, and CORS requests, respectively. It then combines several routes together using the `~` operator. These routes include the `apiR` route, which combines all of the `apiRoutes` defined in the constructor, the `apiSpecR` route, which serves the OpenAPI specification for the API, and the `swaggerRoute` and `panelRoute` routes, which serve the Swagger UI and node panel, respectively. Finally, the `redirectToSwaggerR` route redirects the root URL to the Swagger UI.

Overall, the `ErgoHttpService` class defines the main HTTP service for the Ergo platform, combining several routes together and handling rejections, exceptions, and CORS requests. It can be used to start the HTTP server and serve the API, Swagger UI, and node panel to clients. 

Example usage:

```scala
val apiRoutes = Seq[ApiRoute](... // define API routes here)
val swaggerRoute = SwaggerRoute(...)
val panelRoute = NodePanelRoute(...)
val ergoHttpService = ErgoHttpService(apiRoutes, swaggerRoute, panelRoute)
val bindingFuture = Http().bindAndHandle(ergoHttpService.compositeRoute, "localhost", 8080)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoHttpService` class?
- The `ErgoHttpService` class is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses for the Ergo platform, and it includes routes for the API, Swagger documentation, and a node panel.

2. What is the `compositeRoute` method doing?
- The `compositeRoute` method is combining several routes together using the `handleRejections`, `handleExceptions`, and `corsHandler` directives, and then returning the resulting route.

3. What is the `apiSpecR` method doing?
- The `apiSpecR` method is defining a route that responds to GET requests for the path `/api-docs/openapi.yaml` by returning the contents of a resource file named `openapi.yaml` located in the `api` directory.
