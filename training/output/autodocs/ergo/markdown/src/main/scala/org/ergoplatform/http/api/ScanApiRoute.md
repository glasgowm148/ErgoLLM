The `ScanApiRoute` class is responsible for serving external scans in the Ergo platform. It contains methods to register, deregister, and list external scans, as well as to track or stop tracking some box and list boxes not spent yet. 

The class extends `WalletApiOperations` and `ApiCodecs`, which provide additional functionality for interacting with the Ergo wallet and encoding/decoding JSON objects, respectively. 

The `ScanApiRoute` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `readersHolder`, which is an `ActorRef` used to hold the readers for the wallet, and `ergoSettings`, which is an instance of `ErgoSettings` that contains various settings for the Ergo platform. 

The `ScanApiRoute` class overrides the `settings` and `route` methods from `RESTApiSettings` and defines its own implementation. The `route` method defines the various endpoints for the API, including `registerR`, `deregisterR`, `listScansR`, `unspentR`, `spentR`, `stopTrackingR`, and `addBoxR`. 

The `registerR` method registers a new scan with the wallet. It takes a `ScanRequest` object as input and returns a `ScanIdWrapper` object as output. The `deregisterR` method deregisters a scan with the wallet. It takes a `ScanIdWrapper` object as input and returns a `ScanIdWrapper` object as output. The `listScansR` method lists all registered scans with the wallet. It takes no input and returns a list of `ScanEntity` objects as output. 

The `unspentR` method lists all unspent boxes for a given scan. It takes a `scanIdInt` parameter, which is the ID of the scan, and several optional parameters that filter the results. It returns a list of `WalletBox` objects as output. The `spentR` method lists all spent boxes for a given scan. It takes a `scanIdInt` parameter, which is the ID of the scan, and several optional parameters that filter the results. It returns a list of `WalletBox` objects as output. 

The `stopTrackingR` method stops tracking a box for a given scan. It takes a `ScanIdBoxId` object as input and returns a `ScanIdBoxId` object as output. The `addBoxR` method adds a box to a given scan. It takes a `BoxWithScanIds` object as input and returns the ID of the added box as output. 

Overall, the `ScanApiRoute` class provides a set of endpoints for interacting with external scans in the Ergo platform. These endpoints can be used by external applications to register, deregister, and track boxes for various purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a class that provides methods to register, deregister, and list external scans, and also to serve them. It has methods to track or stop tracking some box and a method to list boxes not spent yet.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries such as Akka, io.circe, and scorex.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `unspentR` method?
- The `unspentR` method expects an integer `scanIdInt` and several optional parameters such as `minConfNum`, `maxConfNum`, `minHeight`, and `maxHeight`. It returns a list of unspent boxes that match the given scan ID and satisfy the specified conditions.
