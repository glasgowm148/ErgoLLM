The `UtxoApiRoute` class is a part of the `ergo` project and provides an HTTP API for interacting with the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set of the Ergo blockchain. The UTXO set is a database of all unspent transaction outputs, which can be used as inputs for new transactions. The purpose of this API is to allow clients to query the UTXO set and retrieve information about specific boxes (i.e., unspent transaction outputs).

The class defines several methods for retrieving information about boxes in the UTXO set. The `byId` method retrieves a box by its identifier, while the `serializedById` method retrieves a serialized version of the box. The `withPoolById` and `withPoolSerializedById` methods are similar to `byId` and `serializedById`, but also include information about the current mempool (i.e., the set of unconfirmed transactions). Finally, the `genesis` method retrieves the genesis boxes of the blockchain, which are the initial boxes that were created when the blockchain was first launched.

The class uses Akka HTTP to define the API routes and Scorex to provide the `ApiResponse` class, which is used to wrap the responses returned by the API methods. The `ErgoBaseApiRoute` trait is also extended, which provides some common functionality for Ergo API routes.

Overall, the `UtxoApiRoute` class provides a simple and convenient way for clients to interact with the UTXO set of the Ergo blockchain. Clients can use this API to retrieve information about specific boxes, which can then be used as inputs for new transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UtxoApiRoute` class?
- The `UtxoApiRoute` class is an API route for interacting with the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) set of the Ergo blockchain.

2. What is the difference between the `byId` and `serializedById` methods?
- The `byId` method returns the `ErgoBox` with the given ID as a JSON object, while the `serializedById` method returns the serialized bytes of the `ErgoBox` with the given ID as a JSON object.

3. What is the purpose of the `getBoxesBinaryProof` method?
- The `getBoxesBinaryProof` method generates a batch proof for a given sequence of `ErgoBox` IDs and returns it as a Base16-encoded string.
