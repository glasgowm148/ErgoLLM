The code provided is a Scala trait called `CorsHandler` that provides tools for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) spec workflow. CORS is a security feature implemented in web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. The `CorsHandler` trait provides a way to handle CORS requests and responses in an HTTP server built using Akka HTTP.

The trait defines a list of `corsResponseHeaders` that are added to the HTTP response headers to allow cross-origin requests. These headers include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`. The `corsHandler` method takes a `Route` and returns a new `Route` that adds the CORS headers to the response and handles preflight requests. The `addCorsHeaders` method takes an `HttpResponse` and returns a new `HttpResponse` with the CORS headers added.

The `addAccessControlHeaders` method is a directive that adds the CORS headers to the response. The `preflightRequestHandler` method handles preflight requests by returning an HTTP response with the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header set to allow the HTTP methods `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, and `DELETE`.

This trait can be used in an Akka HTTP server to handle CORS requests and responses. For example, a server route that requires CORS handling can be wrapped with the `corsHandler` method to add the necessary headers and handle preflight requests. 

```scala
val myRoute: Route = path("myPath") {
  // route logic here
}

val corsRoute: Route = corsHandler(myRoute)
``` 

Overall, the `CorsHandler` trait provides a simple way to handle CORS requests and responses in an Akka HTTP server.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides tools for handling a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing spec workflow (including `OPTIONS` pre-flight requests) through the `CorsHandler` trait.

2. What HTTP methods are allowed by the `preflightRequestHandler`?
    
    The `preflightRequestHandler` allows the HTTP methods OPTIONS, POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE.

3. What headers are allowed by the `corsResponseHeaders`?
    
    The `corsResponseHeaders` allow the headers Authorization, Content-Type, X-Requested-With, and api_key.
