The `ScorexContext` class is a data structure that holds information about the current state of the Scorex application. It contains three fields: `messageSpecs`, `upnpGateway`, and `externalNodeAddress`.

The `messageSpecs` field is a sequence of `MessageSpec` objects, which define the types of messages that the application can send and receive over the network. These message specs are used by the `PeerManager` to handle incoming messages and dispatch them to the appropriate handlers.

The `upnpGateway` field is an optional `UPnPGateway` object, which is used to automatically configure port forwarding on the user's router. This is useful for allowing incoming connections to the application from other nodes on the network.

The `externalNodeAddress` field is an optional `InetSocketAddress` object, which specifies the external IP address and port number of the node. This is used to advertise the node's address to other nodes on the network, so that they can connect to it.

Overall, the `ScorexContext` class provides a way for the application to store and access important configuration information, such as the types of messages it can handle and its network address. This information is used by other components of the application to perform their tasks, such as the `PeerManager` for handling incoming messages and the `NetworkController` for managing network connections.

Example usage:

```scala
val messageSpecs = Seq(
  MyMessageSpec1,
  MyMessageSpec2,
  MyMessageSpec3
)

val upnpGateway = Some(new UPnPGateway())

val externalNodeAddress = Some(new InetSocketAddress("192.168.1.100", 8080))

val context = ScorexContext(messageSpecs, upnpGateway, externalNodeAddress)

// Use the context to initialize other components of the application
val peerManager = new PeerManager(context)
val networkController = new NetworkController(context)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScorexContext` case class?
    
    The `ScorexContext` case class is used to store information related to the Scorex application, including message specifications, UPnP gateway, and external node address.

2. What is the significance of the `messageSpecs` parameter in the `ScorexContext` case class?
    
    The `messageSpecs` parameter in the `ScorexContext` case class is used to store a sequence of `MessageSpec` objects, which define the message types that can be sent and received by the Scorex application.

3. What is the role of the `UPnPGateway` and `externalNodeAddress` parameters in the `ScorexContext` case class?
    
    The `UPnPGateway` parameter in the `ScorexContext` case class is used to store an optional UPnP gateway, which can be used to automatically configure network settings. The `externalNodeAddress` parameter is used to store an optional external node address, which can be used to connect to other nodes in the network.
