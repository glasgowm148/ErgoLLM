The `ReemissionRules` class and object contain code for the re-emission feature of the Ergo blockchain. The `ReemissionRules` class extends the `ReemissionContracts` trait, which defines the re-emission contracts. The class also contains a `basicChargeAmount` variable, which specifies the amount of ERG taken from emission to re-emission initially. The `reemissionForHeight` method takes a height and an `EmissionRules` object and returns how many re-emission tokens can be unlocked at the given height. The method checks if the height is greater than or equal to the activation height and if the emission is greater than or equal to the basic charge amount plus three times the coins in one Ergo. If so, the method returns the basic charge amount times the coins in one Ergo. If the height is greater than or equal to the activation height and the emission is greater than three times the coins in one Ergo, the method returns the emission minus three times the coins in one Ergo. Otherwise, the method returns zero.

The `ReemissionRules` object contains a `injectionBoxP2SAddress` method that takes a boolean `mainnet` parameter and returns a Pay2SAddress object for a box used to carry emission NFT and re-emission tokens to inject them into the emission box on activation height. The method creates a source string that checks if the value of the first input is greater than 30000000L times 1000000000L. The method then compiles the source string using the SigmaCompiler and returns a Pay2SAddress object with the compiled value.

The `ReemissionRules` object also contains a `main` method that prints various information about the monetary and re-emission settings, emission rules, and re-emission rules. The method calculates the total re-emission and the total number of blocks that the re-emission is enough for. The method also prints the emission at the re-emission start height and the tokens. 

Overall, the `ReemissionRules` class and object provide the contracts and helper functions for the re-emission feature of the Ergo blockchain. The `ReemissionRules` class provides a method to calculate how many re-emission tokens can be unlocked at a given height, while the `ReemissionRules` object provides a method to create a Pay2SAddress object for a box used to carry emission NFT and re-emission tokens. The `main` method in the `ReemissionRules` object prints various information about the monetary and re-emission settings, emission rules, and re-emission rules.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReemissionRules` class and how does it relate to the `ReemissionContracts` trait?
- The `ReemissionRules` class contains helper functions for re-emission and overrides values from the `ReemissionContracts` trait. It is used to determine how many re-emission tokens can be unlocked at a given height.

2. What is the purpose of the `injectionBoxP2SAddress` method and how is it used?
- The `injectionBoxP2SAddress` method returns a Pay2SAddress for a box used to carry emission NFT and re-emission tokens to inject them into the emission box on activation height. It takes a boolean parameter to specify whether to create an address for mainnet or testnet.

3. What is the purpose of the `main` method in the `ReemissionRules` object and what does it output?
- The `main` method outputs various information related to monetary and re-emission settings, emission and re-emission at different heights, and total re-emission. It also calculates how many blocks the total re-emission is enough for.
