The `ScanWalletInteraction` object defines an enumeration of three possible values for a flag that determines how a scan interacts with an in-built P2PK wallet. The three options are `Off`, `Shared`, and `Forced`. 

If a box associated with a scan has an interaction flag of `Off`, the box will only be added to the scan. If the flag is `Shared`, the box can be in both the wallet and the scan if the wallet finds it (the box is protected by wallet-related P2PK). If the flag is `Forced`, the box is always added to the wallet if it is added to the scan.

The object also provides three methods for serializing and deserializing the flag to and from a byte value, as well as a method for determining whether a box found for a scan with the given flag should be added to the P2PK wallet.

This code is likely used in the larger project to manage the interaction between scans and the in-built P2PK wallet. Developers working on the project can use this object to set the interaction flag for a scan and determine whether boxes found during the scan should be added to the wallet. For example, if a developer wants to create a scan that only adds boxes to the scan and not the wallet, they can set the interaction flag to `Off`. 

Code example:

```scala
val scanInteraction = ScanWalletInteraction.Shared
val shouldAddToWallet = ScanWalletInteraction.interactingWithWallet(scanInteraction)
println(s"Should add to wallet: $shouldAddToWallet")
```

This code sets the `scanInteraction` variable to `Shared`, indicating that boxes found during the scan can be added to both the scan and the wallet if the wallet finds them. The `interactingWithWallet` method is then called with `scanInteraction` as an argument to determine whether boxes found during the scan should be added to the wallet. The result is printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an enumeration called `ScanWalletInteraction` which represents the interaction between a scan and an in-built P2PK wallet. It also provides methods for serializing and deserializing the enumeration values.

2. What are the possible values of the `ScanWalletInteraction` enumeration?
- The possible values are `Off`, `Shared`, and `Forced`. `Off` means that a box associated with a scan with interaction flag == off will only be added to the scan. `Shared` means that a box can be in both the wallet and the scan if the wallet finds it (box is protected by wallet-related P2PK). `Forced` means that a box is always added to the wallet if it is added to the scan.

3. What is the purpose of the `toByte` and `fromByte` methods?
- The `toByte` method serializes a `ScanWalletInteraction` enumeration value to a byte value representing it. The `fromByte` method deserializes a byte value to a `ScanWalletInteraction` enumeration value. These methods are used in scan deserialization.
