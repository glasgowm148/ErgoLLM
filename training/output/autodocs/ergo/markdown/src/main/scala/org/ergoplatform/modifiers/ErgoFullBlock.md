The `ErgoFullBlock` class is a data structure that represents a full block in the Ergo blockchain. It contains the header, block transactions, extension, and optionally, the associated authenticated data (AD) proofs. This class extends the `TransactionsCarryingPersistentNodeViewModifier` trait, which is a part of the Scorex framework and provides functionality for working with persistent node view modifiers that carry transactions.

The `ErgoFullBlock` class has several methods that allow accessing and manipulating its properties. For example, the `transactions` method returns a sequence of `ErgoTransaction` objects contained in the block, while the `size` method returns the size of the block in bytes. The `height` method returns the height of the block in the blockchain.

The `ErgoFullBlock` object provides two implicit JSON encoders and a decoder for serializing and deserializing `ErgoFullBlock` objects to and from JSON format. The `jsonEncoder` encodes an `ErgoFullBlock` object to a JSON object that contains the header, block transactions, extension, AD proofs, and size. The `jsonDecoder` decodes a JSON object to an `ErgoFullBlock` object. The `blockSizeEncoder` encodes an `ErgoFullBlock` object to a JSON object that contains the block ID and size.

This code is an essential part of the Ergo blockchain project as it defines the data structure for a full block, which is a fundamental component of the blockchain. It also provides functionality for working with blocks, such as accessing transactions and calculating block size. The JSON encoders and decoder are useful for communicating with other systems that use JSON format.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoFullBlock` class and what does it contain?
- The `ErgoFullBlock` class represents a full block in the Ergo blockchain and contains a header, block transactions, an extension, and optionally an ADProofs object.

2. What is the purpose of the `TransactionsCarryingPersistentNodeViewModifier` trait and how is it used in this code?
- The `TransactionsCarryingPersistentNodeViewModifier` trait is used to indicate that the `ErgoFullBlock` class carries transactions and can be used as a persistent node view modifier in the Ergo blockchain.

3. Why is the `serializer` method in the `ErgoFullBlock` class throwing an error?
- The `serializer` method is throwing an error because serialization for `ErgoFullBlock` is not implemented and will not be implemented.
