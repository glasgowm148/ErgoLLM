This code file is part of the Ergo project and contains a list of French words. These words can be used for various purposes within the project, such as generating random text, creating word-based games, or implementing language-related algorithms.

The words are organized alphabetically and cover a wide range of topics, including animals, objects, emotions, actions, and more. This comprehensive list can be utilized for tasks like text analysis, natural language processing, or machine learning applications that require a diverse vocabulary.

For example, if the Ergo project includes a word-guessing game, this list can be used to randomly select words for the game:

```python
import random

word_list = [...]  # The list of words from the code file
random_word = random.choice(word_list)
```

Or, if the project involves text analysis, the list can be used to check if a given word is part of the French vocabulary:

```python
def is_french_word(word):
    return word in word_list

word = "chien"
print(is_french_word(word))  # Output: True
```

In summary, this code file provides a valuable resource for the Ergo project by offering a comprehensive list of French words that can be used in various language-related tasks, such as text analysis, natural language processing, or game development.
