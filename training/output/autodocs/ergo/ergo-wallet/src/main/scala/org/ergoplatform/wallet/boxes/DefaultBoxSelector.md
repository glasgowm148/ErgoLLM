The `DefaultBoxSelector` class is a part of the `ergo` project and is responsible for selecting boxes to be used in a transaction. It is used to pick boxes until the sum of their monetary values meets the target Ergo balance. Then, it checks which assets are not fulfilled and adds boxes until the target asset values are met. 

The `DefaultBoxSelector` class takes an iterator of `ErgoBoxAssets` as input, which is a trait that represents an Ergo box with assets. It also takes an external filter function that is used to filter the boxes. The target Ergo balance and target assets are also passed as input. The class returns an `Either` type, which is either a `BoxSelectionError` or a `BoxSelectionResult`. 

The `select` method is the main method of the class, which selects the boxes. It uses a helper function called `pickBoxes` to pick boxes until the target Ergo balance is met. It then picks boxes until all the target asset amounts are met. If there are not enough boxes to meet the target asset amounts, it returns a `NotEnoughTokensError`. If there are not enough boxes to meet the target Ergo balance, it returns a `NotEnoughErgsError`. 

The `formChangeBoxes` method is a helper method that constructs change outputs. It takes the found balance, target balance, found box assets, and target box assets as input. It returns an `Either` type, which is either a `BoxSelectionError` or a sequence of `ErgoBoxAssets`. 

The `diffCount` method is a helper function that returns the count of assets in the `initialMap` that are not fully spent in the `subtractor`. 

Overall, the `DefaultBoxSelector` class is an important part of the `ergo` project as it is responsible for selecting boxes to be used in a transaction. It is a default implementation of the box selector and can be used as is or extended to fit specific use cases.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DefaultBoxSelector` class?
- The `DefaultBoxSelector` class is an implementation of the box selector that selects boxes until the sum of their monetary values meets the target Ergo balance, and then checks which assets are not fulfilled and adds boxes until target asset values are met.

2. What is the purpose of the `formChangeBoxes` method?
- The `formChangeBoxes` method is a helper method that constructs change outputs by subtracting the target assets from the found box assets, grouping the assets into boxes, and ensuring that each box has at least a minimum amount of ERG assigned.

3. What are the possible errors that can be returned by the `select` method?
- The possible errors that can be returned by the `select` method are `NotEnoughErgsError` if there are not enough boxes to meet the ERG needs, `NotEnoughTokensError` if there are not enough boxes to meet the token needs, and `NotEnoughCoinsForChangeBoxesError` if there are not enough nanoERGs to create the change boxes.
