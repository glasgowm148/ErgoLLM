The `ErgoInterpreter` class is a language interpreter for the ErgoTree language, which is used in the Ergo platform. It extends the `ErgoLikeInterpreter` class and adds rules for validating the spending of expired boxes. The `ErgoLikeParameters` parameter is used to provide the current values of adjustable blockchain settings.

The `checkExpiredBox` method checks whether an expired box is spent properly according to the storage fee rule. It takes in the box being spent, the newly created box when the storage fee is covered, and the current height of the blockchain. It calculates the storage fee based on the `storageFeeFactor` parameter in `params` and the length of the box in bytes. It then checks whether the storage fee is covered, whether the creation height of the output box is correct, whether the value of the output box is correct, and whether all the registers except for `R0` (monetary value) and `R3` (creation height and reference) are preserved.

The `verify` method checks whether a given expression evaluates to `true`. It takes in the environment to use during expression evaluation, the expression to check, the expression evaluation context, the cryptographic proof, and the message. It first checks whether the box has been expired for longer than the `StoragePeriod` and whether no spending proof has been provided. If so, it checks whether an index of a recreated box (or any box if the value in the expired box isn't enough to pay for the storage fee) has been provided in the context extension variable `#127`. If this is the case, it calls the `checkExpiredBox` method to check whether the box is spent properly and returns the cost of the storage contract. If not, it calls the `verify` method of the `ErgoLikeInterpreter` class.

The `avlTreeFromDigest` method creates an `AvlTreeData` object with the given digest and all operations enabled. It takes in an `ADDigest` object and returns an `AvlTreeData` object.

The `ErgoInterpreter` class can be used in the larger project to interpret ErgoTree expressions and validate the spending of expired boxes. An example of how to use it is as follows:

```
val params: ErgoLikeParameters = ...
val interpreter: ErgoInterpreter = ErgoInterpreter(params)
val env: ScriptEnv = ...
val exp: ErgoTree = ...
val context: ErgoLikeContext = ...
val proof: Array[Byte] = ...
val message: Array[Byte] = ...
val result: Try[VerificationResult] = interpreter.verify(env, exp, context, proof, message)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `checkExpiredBox` method?
- The `checkExpiredBox` method checks whether an expired box is spent properly according to the storage fee rule.

2. What is the significance of the `Constants.StorageIndexVarId` variable?
- The `Constants.StorageIndexVarId` variable is used to store an index of a recreated box (or index of any box if the value in the expired box isn't enough to pay for the storage fee) in the context extension variable #127.

3. What is the initial cost of instantiating an interpreter and creating ErgoLikeContext?
- The initial cost of instantiating an interpreter and creating ErgoLikeContext is 10000.
