The code in the `EncryptionSettings.scala` and `SecretStorageSettings.scala` files are part of the `org.ergoplatform.wallet.settings` package and provide functionality for handling encryption and secret storage settings in the Ergo platform wallet.

`EncryptionSettings.scala` defines a case class `EncryptionSettings` with three parameters: `prf`, `c`, and `dkLen`. These parameters represent the pseudo-random function, the number of PBKDF2 iterations, and the desired bit-length of the derived key, respectively. The file also provides `EncryptionSettingsEncoder` and `EncryptionSettingsDecoder` objects for encoding and decoding `EncryptionSettings` objects to and from JSON format using the `io.circe` library.

Here's an example of encoding an `EncryptionSettings` object to JSON:

```scala
import org.ergoplatform.wallet.settings.EncryptionSettings
import io.circe.syntax._

val settings = EncryptionSettings("AES-256", 10000, 256)
val json = settings.asJson
```

And decoding a JSON object back into an `EncryptionSettings` object:

```scala
import org.ergoplatform.wallet.settings.EncryptionSettings
import io.circe.parser._

val jsonString = """{"prf":"AES-256","c":10000,"dkLen":256}"""
val json = parse(jsonString).getOrElse(throw new Exception("Invalid JSON"))
val settings = json.as[EncryptionSettings].getOrElse(throw new Exception("Invalid EncryptionSettings"))
```

`SecretStorageSettings.scala` defines a case class `SecretStorageSettings` with two properties: `secretDir` and `encryption`. The `secretDir` property is a string representing the directory where secrets will be stored, while the `encryption` property is an instance of the `EncryptionSettings` class.

Here's an example of using the `SecretStorageSettings` class:

```scala
val secretDir = "/path/to/secret/dir"
val encryptionSettings = EncryptionSettings("AES", 256)
val secretStorageSettings = SecretStorageSettings(secretDir, encryptionSettings)

// Use the secretStorageSettings instance to store and retrieve secrets securely
```

These classes can be used in the larger Ergo platform wallet project to securely store and retrieve sensitive information, such as private keys, by specifying the directory for secret storage and the encryption settings to be used for encrypting the secrets.
