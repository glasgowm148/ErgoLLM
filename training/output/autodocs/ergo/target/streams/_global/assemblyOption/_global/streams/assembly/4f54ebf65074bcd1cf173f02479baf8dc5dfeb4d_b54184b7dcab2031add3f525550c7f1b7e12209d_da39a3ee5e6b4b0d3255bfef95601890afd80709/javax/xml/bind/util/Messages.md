This file contains a set of error messages that are used in the ergo project. These error messages are related to the JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) API, which is used to convert XML data to and from Java objects. 

The error messages are defined as static variables with string values. They are used to provide more informative error messages when an exception is thrown during the execution of JAXB-related code. For example, if the unmarshaller object is null, the error message "Unmarshaller can not be null" will be displayed.

These error messages are used throughout the ergo project to provide more informative error messages to developers and users. They help to identify the cause of the error and provide guidance on how to fix it. 

Here is an example of how these error messages might be used in the ergo project:

```java
try {
    JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(MyClass.class);
    Unmarshaller unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();
    MyClass myObject = (MyClass) unmarshaller.unmarshal(xmlFile);
} catch (JAXBException e) {
    throw new MyCustomException(JAXBResult.NullUnmarshaller, e);
}
```

In this example, if the unmarshaller object is null, the error message "Unmarshaller can not be null" will be passed to the MyCustomException constructor along with the original exception. This will provide more information about the cause of the exception and help developers to fix the issue.
