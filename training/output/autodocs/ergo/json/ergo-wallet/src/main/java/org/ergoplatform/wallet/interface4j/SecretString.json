  "summary": "The `SecretString` class is a utility class that provides a more secure way of handling secret data than using a `char[]` directly. It encapsulates a secret array of characters and provides methods to erase the data from memory and check if the data has already been erased. \n\nThe class has a private constructor and static factory methods to create new instances. The `create(char[] data)` method creates a new instance wrapping the given characters, while the `create(String s)` method creates a new instance by copying characters from the given `String`. The `empty()` method creates a new instance with an empty sequence of characters.\n\nThe `SecretString` class provides methods to access and manipulate the secret data. The `isEmpty()` method returns `true` if the string doesn't have characters. The `getData()` method extracts the secret characters as an array. The `erase()` method erases the secret characters stored in the instance so that they no longer reside in memory. The `isErased()` method returns `true` if the string has been erased. \n\nThe `SecretString` class also provides methods to check for equality and hash code. The `equals(Object obj)` method checks if two `SecretString` instances are equal, while the `hashCode()` method returns the hash code of the secret data. Both methods throw a runtime exception if the `SecretString` instance has already been erased.\n\nFinally, the `toStringUnsecure()` method returns an unsecured `String` with secret characters. The secret characters are copied to the new `String` instance and cannot be erased in memory, so they may remain in memory until overwritten by new data. The usage of this method is discouraged, and it is provided solely to interact with legacy code that keeps secret characters in `String`.\n\nOverall, the `SecretString` class provides a more secure and safe way of handling secret data than using a `char[]` directly. It can be used in the larger project to handle sensitive data such as passwords, private keys, and other secret information.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SecretString` class?\n- The `SecretString` class encapsulates a secret array of characters with proper equality, and provides methods to erase the secret data in memory and prevent it from being leaked to GC. It is more secure and safe to use than using char[] directly.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `_erased` flag?\n- The `_erased` flag indicates whether the secret characters stored in the `SecretString` instance have been erased from memory. If the flag is true, certain methods will throw a runtime exception.\n\n3. Why does the `toStringUnsecure()` method exist, and when should it be used?\n- The `toStringUnsecure()` method returns an unsecured String with secret characters, which are copied to the new String instance and cannot be erased in memory. This method is discouraged and should only be used to interact with legacy code which keeps secret characters in String."
