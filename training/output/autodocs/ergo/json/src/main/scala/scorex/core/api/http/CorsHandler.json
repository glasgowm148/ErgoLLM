  "summary": "The code provided is a Scala trait called `CorsHandler` that provides tools for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) spec workflow. CORS is a security feature implemented in web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. The `CorsHandler` trait provides a way to handle CORS requests and responses in an HTTP server built using Akka HTTP.\n\nThe trait defines a list of `corsResponseHeaders` that are added to the HTTP response headers to allow cross-origin requests. These headers include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`. The `corsHandler` method takes a `Route` and returns a new `Route` that adds the CORS headers to the response and handles preflight requests. The `addCorsHeaders` method takes an `HttpResponse` and returns a new `HttpResponse` with the CORS headers added.\n\nThe `addAccessControlHeaders` method is a directive that adds the CORS headers to the response. The `preflightRequestHandler` method handles preflight requests by returning an HTTP response with the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header set to allow the HTTP methods `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, and `DELETE`.\n\nThis trait can be used in an Akka HTTP server to handle CORS requests and responses. For example, a server route that requires CORS handling can be wrapped with the `corsHandler` method to add the necessary headers and handle preflight requests. \n\n```scala\nval myRoute: Route = path(\"myPath\") {\n  // route logic here\n}\n\nval corsRoute: Route = corsHandler(myRoute)\n``` \n\nOverall, the `CorsHandler` trait provides a simple way to handle CORS requests and responses in an Akka HTTP server.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code provides tools for handling a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing spec workflow (including `OPTIONS` pre-flight requests) through the `CorsHandler` trait.\n\n2. What HTTP methods are allowed by the `preflightRequestHandler`?\n    \n    The `preflightRequestHandler` allows the HTTP methods OPTIONS, POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE.\n\n3. What headers are allowed by the `corsResponseHeaders`?\n    \n    The `corsResponseHeaders` allow the headers Authorization, Content-Type, X-Requested-With, and api_key."
