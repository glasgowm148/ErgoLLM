  "summary": "The code defines a custom merge strategy for use in the ergo project. Specifically, it provides a merge strategy suitable for merging configuration files. \n\nThe `CustomMergeStrategy` object defines a single `val` named `concatReversed`, which is an instance of the `MergeStrategy` trait. This trait defines a single method, `apply`, which takes a temporary directory, a path, and a sequence of files, and returns either an error message or a sequence of pairs of files and paths. \n\nThe `concatReversed` merge strategy works by concatenating the contents of the input files in reverse order, and writing the result to a new file in the temporary directory. The resulting file is then returned as a pair with the original path. The `IO.transfer` method is used to copy the contents of each input file to the output file, and the `IO.read` method is used to check if the last character of the input file is a newline character. If not, a newline character is added to the output file. \n\nThis merge strategy is designed to be used with the `sbtassembly` plugin, which is used to create a single, executable JAR file from multiple project dependencies. The `sbtassembly` plugin allows users to specify custom merge strategies for handling conflicts between files with the same path. By using the `concatReversed` merge strategy, the ergo project can ensure that configuration files are merged in a consistent and predictable manner. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport sbtassembly.AssemblyPlugin.autoImport._\n\n// Add the custom merge strategy to the assembly merge strategy list\nassemblyMergeStrategy in assembly := {\n  case \"path/to/config/file\" => CustomMergeStrategy.concatReversed\n  case x => MergeStrategy.defaultMergeStrategy(x)\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a custom merge strategy for sbt assembly that concatenates files in reverse order.\n\n2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?\n   - The `apply` method takes a temporary directory, a path, and a sequence of files as input, and returns either an error message or a sequence of tuples containing a merged file and its path.\n\n3. How is the custom merge strategy implemented?\n   - The `concatReversed` merge strategy is implemented as a new instance of the `MergeStrategy` trait, which overrides the `apply` method to concatenate files in reverse order and add a newline character between them."
