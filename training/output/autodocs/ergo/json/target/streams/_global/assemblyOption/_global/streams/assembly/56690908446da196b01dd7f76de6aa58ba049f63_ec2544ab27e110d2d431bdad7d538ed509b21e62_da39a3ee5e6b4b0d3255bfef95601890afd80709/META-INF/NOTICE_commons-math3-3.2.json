  "summary": "This file contains information about the various classes and packages in the ergo project that include software developed by third-party sources. The purpose of this file is to provide attribution and acknowledge the contributions of these external sources to the ergo project. \n\nThe file includes information about the following classes and packages: \n- Erf class: This class includes an implementation of the inverse error function based on CUDA code developed by Mike Giles. \n- BracketFinder and PowellOptimizer classes: These classes are based on Python code in the SciPy library developed by Travis E. Oliphant. \n- LinearConstraint, LinearObjectiveFunction, LinearOptimizer, RelationShip, SimplexSolver, and SimplexTableau classes: These classes include software developed by Benjamin McCann and distributed by Google Inc. \n- LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer class: This class includes software translated from Fortran routines in the Minpack package developed by the University of Chicago. \n- GraggBulirschStoerIntegrator class: This class includes software translated from the odex Fortran routine developed by E. Hairer and G. Wanner. \n- EigenDecompositionImpl class: This class includes software translated from LAPACK Fortran routines developed by the University of Tennessee. \n- MersenneTwister class: This class includes software translated from the Mersenne-Twister generator written in C by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura. \n- LocalizedFormatsTest class: This class is an adapted version of the OrekitMessagesTest class from the orekit library. \n- HermiteInterpolator class: This class has been imported from the orekit library. \n\nThe file also includes information about the creation of the package \"o.a.c.m.analysis.integration.gauss,\" which was inspired by original code donated by SÃ©bastien Brisard. \n\nOverall, this file serves as a record of the various external sources that have contributed to the ergo project. It provides attribution and acknowledges the contributions of these sources to the project.",
