      "summary": "The code above is a configuration file for the Ergo project. It contains settings that can be uncommented and modified to overwrite default values. The configuration file is divided into two main sections: `ergo` and `scorex`.\n\nThe `ergo` section contains settings related to the Ergo node and wallet. The `node` subsection allows the user to specify the type of state to be kept by the node. The two options are `utxo` and `digest`. If `utxo` is selected, the node will keep the full UTXO set, which allows for the validation of arbitrary blocks and the generation of ADProofs. If `digest` is selected, the node will only keep the state root hash and validate transactions via ADProofs. The `mining` and `useExternalMiner` settings allow the user to specify whether the node is doing mining and whether an external miner is being used. The `miningPubKeyHex` setting allows the user to specify the public key to which mining rewards will be dedicated.\n\nThe `wallet` subsection contains settings related to the Ergo wallet. The `mnemonicPhraseLanguage` setting allows the user to specify the language to be used in the mnemonic seed. The `keepSpentBoxes` setting allows the user to specify whether used boxes should be saved or deleted immediately.\n\nThe `scorex` section contains settings related to the Scorex framework, which is used by the Ergo project. The `network` subsection allows the user to specify the node name to be sent during handshake, a list of well-known nodes, and the network address to bind to. The `restApi` subsection allows the user to specify the network address to bind to and an API key hash.\n\nOverall, this configuration file allows the user to customize various settings related to the Ergo node and wallet, as well as the Scorex framework. By uncommenting and modifying the appropriate settings, the user can tailor the Ergo project to their specific needs. For example, they can specify the type of state to be kept by the node, the language to be used in the mnemonic seed, and the network address to bind to.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains settings for the Ergo blockchain node and wallet, as well as the Scorex network and REST API.\n\n2. What are some of the configurable options for the Ergo node and wallet?\n- The node can be set to keep a full utxo set or just the state root hash, and can also be configured for mining and external mining. The wallet can be set to use a specific language for the mnemonic seed and to keep spent boxes or delete them immediately.\n\n3. What are some of the configurable options for the Scorex network and REST API?\n- The network can be configured with a node name and a list of well known nodes, as well as a bind address. The REST API can be configured with a bind address and an API key hash."

  "summary": "The `local.conf.sample` file in the Ergo project serves as a template for users to customize various settings related to the Ergo node, wallet, and the underlying Scorex framework. By uncommenting and modifying the appropriate settings, users can tailor the Ergo project to their specific needs.\n\nThe configuration file is divided into two main sections: `ergo` and `scorex`.\n\n### Ergo Section\n\nThe `ergo` section contains settings related to the Ergo node and wallet.\n\n#### Node Subsection\n\nThe `node` subsection allows the user to specify the type of state to be kept by the node. The two options are `utxo` and `digest`. If `utxo` is selected, the node will keep the full UTXO set, which allows for the validation of arbitrary blocks and the generation of ADProofs. If `digest` is selected, the node will only keep the state root hash and validate transactions via ADProofs.\n\nExample:\n\n```conf\nergo {\n  node {\n    stateType = \"utxo\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Mining Settings\n\nThe `mining` and `useExternalMiner` settings allow the user to specify whether the node is doing mining and whether an external miner is being used. The `miningPubKeyHex` setting allows the user to specify the public key to which mining rewards will be dedicated.\n\nExample:\n\n```conf\nergo {\n  mining = true\n  useExternalMiner = false\n  miningPubKeyHex = \"your_public_key_here\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Wallet Subsection\n\nThe `wallet` subsection contains settings related to the Ergo wallet. The `mnemonicPhraseLanguage` setting allows the user to specify the language to be used in the mnemonic seed. The `keepSpentBoxes` setting allows the user to specify whether used boxes should be saved or deleted immediately.\n\nExample:\n\n```conf\nergo {\n  wallet {\n    mnemonicPhraseLanguage = \"english\"\n    keepSpentBoxes = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Scorex Section\n\nThe `scorex` section contains settings related to the Scorex framework, which is used by the Ergo project.\n\n#### Network Subsection\n\nThe `network` subsection allows the user to specify the node name to be sent during handshake, a list of well-known nodes, and the network address to bind to.\n\nExample:\n\n```conf\nscorex {\n  network {\n    nodeName = \"your_node_name_here\"\n    knownPeers = [\"peer1\", \"peer2\"]\n    bindAddress = \"0.0.0.0:9001\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### RestApi Subsection\n\nThe `restApi` subsection allows the user to specify the network address to bind to and an API key hash.\n\nExample:\n\n```conf\nscorex {\n  restApi {\n    bindAddress = \"0.0.0.0:9052\"\n    apiKeyHash = \"your_api_key_hash_here\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy customizing the settings in the `local.conf.sample` file, users can configure the Ergo node and wallet to suit their requirements, such as specifying the type of state to be kept by the node, the language to be used in the mnemonic seed, and the network address to bind to.",
