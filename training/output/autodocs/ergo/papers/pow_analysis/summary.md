The `compile.sh` script in the `.autodoc/docs/json/papers/pow_analysis` folder is a shell script that automates the process of compiling a LaTeX document into a PDF file and generating a bibliography. It checks if the necessary commands `pdflatex` and `bibtex` are installed on the system, and if they are, it runs a series of commands to compile the LaTeX document and generate the bibliography. This script can be used as part of a larger project that involves writing and compiling LaTeX documents, ensuring that the necessary tools are installed on the system and automating the compilation process.

Here's a brief overview of the script's functionality:

1. Check if `pdflatex` and `bibtex` commands are installed on the system. If not, print an error message and exit.
2. Run `pdflatex main` to compile the LaTeX document into a PDF file.
3. Run `bibtex main` to generate a bibliography for the document.
4. Run `pdflatex main` twice to ensure that all references and citations are properly resolved.
5. Remove auxiliary files generated during the compilation process.

For example, consider a project that involves writing a research paper in LaTeX with a file called `paper.tex` containing the main content and a file called `references.bib` containing the bibliography entries. To compile the paper into a PDF file and generate a bibliography, create a shell script called `compile.sh` with the following code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

command -v pdflatex && command -v bibtex
if [[ "$?" != 0 ]]; then
    echo "Command 'pdflatex' or 'bibtex' not exist, both must be installed. For Ubuntu, try:"
    echo "sudo apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-binaries"
    echo
    echo "You may also need to install additional packages like fonts, etc. For Ubuntu, try:"
    echo "sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended latex-xcolor texlive-latex-extra cm-super"
    exit 1;
fi

pdflatex paper
bibtex paper
pdflatex paper
pdflatex paper
rm paper.aux
rm paper.out
rm paper.toc
rm paper.log
```

Save this script in the same directory as the `paper.tex` and `references.bib` files. Navigate to this directory in the terminal and execute the script with the command `./compile.sh`. The script checks if `pdflatex` and `bibtex` are installed, and if they are, it compiles the `paper.tex` file into a PDF file and generates a bibliography using the `references.bib` file. The resulting PDF file is saved in the same directory as `paper.tex`. The script also removes some auxiliary files generated during the compilation process.

By using this script, the compilation process is automated, and the necessary tools are ensured to be installed on the system, saving time and effort for the user and making the project more efficient.
