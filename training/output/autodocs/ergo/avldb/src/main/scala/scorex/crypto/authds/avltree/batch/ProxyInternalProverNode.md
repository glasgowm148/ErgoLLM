The `ProxyInternalProverNode` class is a part of the `ergo` project and is located in the `scorex.crypto.authds.avltree.batch` package. This class represents an internal node of an AVL tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. The purpose of this class is to allow for lazy loading of a tree by not constructing children nodes during node construction, but only providing pointers to them. Children nodes are read from the database and constructed only when requested, and children internal nodes are of the same type. This allows for efficient memory usage and faster tree construction.

The class takes four parameters: `pk`, `leftLabel`, `rightLabel`, and `pb`. `pk` is the key of the node, `leftLabel` and `rightLabel` are the keys of the left and right children, respectively, and `pb` is the balance of the node. The class extends the `InternalProverNode` class, which is a subclass of the `ProverNodes` trait. The `ProverNodes` trait defines the basic functionality of a node in an AVL tree, such as getting the key, balance, left and right children, and computing the label of the node.

The `ProxyInternalProverNode` class overrides the `computeLabel` method to compute the label of the node. The label is computed using the `hf.hash` method, which takes three parameters: an array of bytes, `leftLabel`, and `rightLabel`. The array of bytes contains the internal node prefix and the balance of the node.

The class also overrides the `left` and `right` methods to get the left and right children of the node. If the left or right child is null, it fetches the child from the database using the `VersionedLDBAVLStorage.fetch` method and constructs the child node.

Overall, the `ProxyInternalProverNode` class provides a way to lazily load an AVL tree by only constructing children nodes when requested. This allows for efficient memory usage and faster tree construction. An example of using this class in the larger project could be constructing an AVL tree of transactions in a blockchain, where the tree is constructed lazily to save memory and improve performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how does it differ from other internal node classes in the project?
- This class is an internal node that allows for lazy loading of a tree by only constructing children nodes when requested. It differs from other internal node classes in that it does not provide children during node construction.
2. What is the significance of the `leftLabel` and `rightLabel` parameters?
- The `leftLabel` and `rightLabel` parameters are pointers to the left and right children nodes in the database, which are read and constructed only when requested.
3. What is the role of the `VersionedLDBAVLStorage` class in this code?
- The `VersionedLDBAVLStorage` class is used to fetch the left and right children nodes from the database when they are requested in the `left` and `right` methods, respectively.
