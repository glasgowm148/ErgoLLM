This script is used to compile a LaTeX document called "teaser.tex" into a PDF file called "teaser.pdf". It first checks if the necessary commands "pdflatex" and "bibtex" are installed on the system by using the "command -v" command. If either of these commands is not found, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.

Assuming both commands are found, the script proceeds to remove any existing "teaser.pdf" file in the current directory. It then runs "pdflatex" on "teaser.tex" to generate an intermediate file called "teaser.aux". This file is used by "bibtex" to generate a bibliography file called "teaser.bbl". The script then runs "pdflatex" twice more to incorporate the bibliography into the final PDF output.

After the PDF is generated, the script removes all intermediate files created during the compilation process, including "teaser.aux", "teaser.log", "teaser.bbl", "teaser.blg", and "teaser.out".

This script can be used as part of a larger project that involves creating LaTeX documents. By automating the compilation process, it saves time and ensures that the final output is consistent and error-free. For example, a project that involves generating multiple reports or papers could use this script to compile each document automatically, rather than relying on manual compilation. 

Example usage:
```
./compile_teaser.sh
```
This will compile the "teaser.tex" file in the current directory and generate a "teaser.pdf" file.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script checks if `pdflatex` and `bibtex` are installed and then compiles a `teaser.tex` file into a PDF, removing any auxiliary files generated during the process.

2. What operating systems is this script compatible with?
   
   This script is designed to work with Unix-based operating systems, as it uses the `sh` shell and includes commands specific to Ubuntu.

3. What is the `teaser.tex` file and how is it related to this script?
   
   The `teaser.tex` file is likely a LaTeX file that contains content to be compiled into a PDF. This script compiles the `teaser.tex` file using `pdflatex` and `bibtex` and removes any auxiliary files generated during the process.
