The `LICENSE-2.0.txt` file in this folder contains the Apache License, Version 2.0, which is a widely used open-source software license that defines the terms and conditions for using, reproducing, and distributing the software within the ergo project. This license grants a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the work and such derivative works in source or object form.

The Apache License also grants a patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such contributor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the work to which such contribution(s) was submitted.

In order to comply with the Apache License, any redistribution of the work or derivative works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in source or object form, must meet certain conditions. These conditions include providing a copy of the license to any other recipients of the work or derivative works, causing any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that the files were changed, retaining all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the source form of the work, and including a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within the NOTICE file if the work includes one.

The license also includes a disclaimer of warranty, stating that the work is provided on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. The license limits the liability of contributors for damages arising as a result of the license or out of the use or inability to use the work, and allows for the acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with the license.

For example, if a developer wants to use a part of the ergo project in their own project, they must comply with the terms and conditions of the Apache License. This includes providing a copy of the license to any recipients of the work or derivative works, retaining all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the source form of the work, and including a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within the NOTICE file if the work includes one.

```python
# Example usage of the ergo project code
import ergo

# Use ergo functions and classes in your own project
result = ergo.some_function()

# Make sure to comply with the Apache License when redistributing your project
```

In summary, the `LICENSE-2.0.txt` file provides the legal framework for the use and distribution of the ergo project, ensuring that the project can be freely used, modified, and distributed while protecting the rights of the contributors and users.
