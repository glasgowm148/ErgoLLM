The `ErgoContext` class is a context object used during transaction verification in the Ergo platform. It contains information about the state of the blockchain, the transaction being verified, and the input being spent. 

The class takes in four parameters: `stateContext`, `transactionContext`, `inputContext`, `costLimit`, and `initCost`. `stateContext` is an instance of `ErgoStateContext` which contains information about the current state of the blockchain. `transactionContext` is an instance of `TransactionContext` which contains information about the transaction being verified. `inputContext` is an instance of `InputContext` which contains information about the input being spent. `costLimit` and `initCost` are both `Long` values that represent the maximum cost and initial cost of executing the transaction.

The `ErgoContext` class extends the `ErgoLikeContext` class which provides a context for executing ErgoScript, the scripting language used in the Ergo platform. The `ErgoLikeContext` class takes in several parameters that are used to execute ErgoScript. These parameters include an AVL+ tree representing the state of the blockchain, the last headers of the blockchain, the pre-header of the current block, the data boxes in the transaction, the boxes being spent in the transaction, the spending transaction, the index of the input being spent, the extension of the input being spent, the validation settings for the sigma protocol, the cost limit, the initial cost, and the activated script version.

The `ErgoContext` class sets the `activatedScriptVersion` parameter of the `ErgoLikeContext` to be one less than the current block version. This is because the script version used in a block is always one less than the block version itself.

Overall, the `ErgoContext` class provides a context object that contains all the necessary information for executing ErgoScript during transaction verification in the Ergo platform. An example of how this class may be used in the larger project is during the validation of a transaction input. The `ErgoContext` object would be created using the relevant state, transaction, and input contexts, and then passed to the `ErgoInterpreter` to execute the ErgoScript in the input's unlocking script.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `ErgoContext` which represents the context to be used during transaction verification.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `ErgoContext` class?
- The inputs of the `ErgoContext` class are `stateContext`, `transactionContext`, `inputContext`, `costLimit`, and `initCost`. The output is an instance of the `ErgoLikeContext` class.

3. What is the significance of the `activatedScriptVersion` parameter?
- The `activatedScriptVersion` parameter specifies the version of the script that should be used during transaction verification, based on the block version of the ErgoProtocol.
