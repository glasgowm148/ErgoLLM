The `NodeApiRoute` class is a part of the Ergo project and is responsible for defining the API routes related to the node. This class extends the `ErgoBaseApiRoute` class and takes in an instance of `ErgoSettings` and an `ActorSystem` as parameters. 

The `route` method is defined in this class and is responsible for defining the API routes for the node. In this case, the route is defined as `(pathPrefix("node") & withAuth)` which means that any API request that starts with `/node` will be handled by this route. The `withAuth` directive ensures that the request is authenticated before it is processed. 

The `shutdown` method is a private method that is called by the `route` method. This method is responsible for handling the `/node/shutdown` API request. When this API is called, the `system.scheduler.scheduleOnce` method is called with a delay of 5 seconds. This method schedules the `ErgoApp.shutdownSystem` method to be called after the specified delay. The `RemoteShutdown` parameter is passed to the `ErgoApp.shutdownSystem` method which indicates that the shutdown request is coming from a remote source. 

The `ApiResponse` method is called with a message indicating that the node will be shut down in 5 seconds. This message is returned as the response to the API request. 

Overall, this class provides an API route for shutting down the node. This can be useful in situations where the node needs to be shut down remotely. For example, if the node is running on a remote server and needs to be shut down for maintenance purposes, this API can be called to initiate the shutdown process. 

Example usage:

Assuming the Ergo node is running on `localhost:9052`, the following API request can be made to initiate the shutdown process:

```
POST http://localhost:9052/node/shutdown
```

The response to this API request will be:

```
{
  "message": "The node will be shut down in 5 seconds"
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a NodeApiRoute class that extends ErgoBaseApiRoute and contains a shutdown method to shut down the ErgoApp system.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
- This code file imports several dependencies, including akka, org.ergoplatform, and scorex.

3. What is the purpose of the shutdownDelay variable?
- The shutdownDelay variable is used to specify the amount of time to wait before shutting down the ErgoApp system after the shutdown method is called. In this case, it is set to 5 seconds.
