This code defines the `ApiCodecs` trait, which provides JSON encoders and decoders for various data types used in the Ergo platform's HTTP API. The purpose of these encoders and decoders is to convert data between JSON format and the corresponding Scala data types, allowing the API to communicate with external clients.

The `ApiCodecs` trait extends the `JsonCodecs` trait, which provides basic JSON encoding and decoding functionality. It also defines several implicit encoders and decoders for specific data types, such as `ErgoTransaction`, `SigmaBoolean`, `TransactionSigningRequest`, and more. These encoders and decoders are used to convert data between JSON and Scala representations when sending and receiving API requests and responses.

For example, the `transactionEncoder` and `transactionDecoder` are used to encode and decode `ErgoTransaction` objects to and from JSON format. Similarly, the `sigmaBooleanEncoder` and `sigmaBooleanDecoder` handle encoding and decoding of `SigmaBoolean` objects.

The `ApiEncoderOption` object defines an abstract class `Detalization` and two case objects `ShowDetails` and `HideDetails`. These are used to control the level of detail included in the JSON output for certain data types, such as `TrackedBox`.

Here's an example of how the encoders and decoders might be used in the larger project:

```scala
import org.ergoplatform.http.api.ApiCodecs._

// Encode an ErgoTransaction object to JSON
val tx: ErgoTransaction = ...
val txJson: Json = tx.asJson

// Decode a JSON object to an ErgoTransaction
val decodedTx: ErgoTransaction = txJson.as[ErgoTransaction].getOrElse(throw new Exception("Failed to decode JSON"))
```

In summary, the `ApiCodecs` trait provides JSON encoding and decoding functionality for various data types used in the Ergo platform's HTTP API, allowing for seamless communication between the API and external clients.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ApiCodecs` trait and how is it used in the project?
   **Answer**: The `ApiCodecs` trait provides implicit encoders and decoders for various data types used in the Ergo project. These encoders and decoders are used to convert data between different formats, such as JSON and internal data structures, when interacting with the Ergo HTTP API.

2. **Question**: What is the role of the `ergoAddressEncoder` and why is it initialized with a `null` value?
   **Answer**: The `ergoAddressEncoder` is an implicit value of type `ErgoAddressEncoder` used to encode Ergo addresses. It is initialized with a `null` value, which is not ideal and could lead to potential issues. Ideally, it should be initialized with a proper instance of `ErgoAddressEncoder`.

3. **Question**: What are the different types of `ApiEncoderOption` and how are they used in the code?
   **Answer**: There are two types of `ApiEncoderOption`: `ShowDetails` and `HideDetails`. They are used to control the level of detail included in the JSON output when encoding certain data structures, such as `TrackedBox`. Depending on the chosen option, the output JSON may include more or less information about the data structure.
