This code is a service worker file that is used in the ergo project. Service workers are scripts that run in the background of a web page and can intercept network requests, cache resources, and provide offline functionality. 

The purpose of this specific service worker is to use Workbox, a set of libraries and build tools for creating service workers, to precache and route URLs in the manifest. The `workboxSW.precacheAndRoute()` method is used to efficiently cache and respond to requests for URLs in the manifest. The `self.__precacheManifest` variable is an array of URLs that are precached and served from the cache when requested. 

The `workbox.routing.registerNavigationRoute()` method is used to register a route for the navigation request to the index.html file. This method takes two arguments, the first being the URL to use as the navigation route, and the second being an object that contains options for the route. The `getCacheKeyForURL()` method is used to get the cache key for the index.html file. The `blacklist` option is used to exclude certain URLs from being handled by the service worker. In this case, URLs that start with `/_` or end with a file extension are excluded. 

The `importScripts()` method is used to import the Workbox library and the precache-manifest file. The `self.addEventListener()` method is used to listen for messages from the web page. If the message is of type `SKIP_WAITING`, the `self.skipWaiting()` method is called to activate the new service worker immediately. 

Overall, this service worker is an important part of the ergo project as it provides offline functionality and improves the performance of the web app by precaching resources. Developers can make changes to the Workbox build configuration to customize the precaching and routing behavior of the service worker.
