The `ErgoStateReader` code defines a trait and an object that provide state-related data and functions for any state implementation in the Ergo platform. The trait provides functions that read the state but do not modify it. The object provides a function to retrieve the current state context from storage.

The `ErgoStateReader` trait has several functions that provide information about the state. The `rootDigest` function returns the root hash and height of the AVL+ tree that authenticates the UTXO set. The `version` function returns the current version of the state, which must be the ID of the last block applied. The `isGenesis` function returns a boolean indicating whether the state is in its genesis version (before the genesis block). The `parameters` function returns the current network parameters used in transaction and block validation. The `genesisBoxes` function returns a sequence of ErgoBoxes that represent the genesis state of the chain.

The `ErgoStateReader` trait also has a `stateContext` function that returns an `ErgoStateContext` object. This object contains the current state context, which includes the UTXO set, the state root hash, and the current network parameters. The `ErgoStateReader` trait uses a `store` object and a `constants` object to retrieve the current state context.

The `ErgoStateReader` object provides a `storageStateContext` function that retrieves the current state context from storage. This function uses a `store` object and a `constants` object to retrieve the current state context. If the current state context cannot be retrieved from storage, the function returns an empty `ErgoStateContext` object.

Overall, the `ErgoStateReader` code provides a way to read the state of the Ergo platform without modifying it. This is useful for various purposes, such as verifying transactions and blocks, and querying the state for information. The `ErgoStateReader` code is used in various parts of the Ergo platform, such as the transaction and block validation code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoStateReader` trait?
- The `ErgoStateReader` trait provides state-related data and functions related to any state implementation ("utxo" or "digest") which are not modifying the state (so only reading it).

2. What is the purpose of the `isGenesis` method?
- The `isGenesis` method checks if the state is in its genesis version (before genesis block).

3. What is the purpose of the `storageStateContext` method in the `ErgoStateReader` object?
- The `storageStateContext` method in the `ErgoStateReader` object retrieves the current state context from the database, or creates a new one if it doesn't exist.
