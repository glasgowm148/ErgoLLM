The `BalancesSnapshot` class is a final case class that is used to represent a snapshot of the balances of a wallet at a specific height in the Ergo blockchain. The class takes in three parameters: `height`, `balance`, and `assetBalances`. 

The `height` parameter is of type `Height` and represents the height of the block at which the snapshot was taken. The `balance` parameter is of type `Long` and represents the total balance of the wallet at the given height. The `assetBalances` parameter is of type `TokensMap` and represents the balances of any assets held in the wallet at the given height.

This class is likely used in the larger project to provide a way for the wallet to keep track of its balances over time. By taking snapshots of the balances at specific heights in the blockchain, the wallet can keep track of how its balances are changing over time. This information can be used to generate reports or to make decisions about how to manage the wallet's funds.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```scala
val currentHeight: Height = ErgoHistory.getCurrentHeight()
val currentBalance: Long = wallet.getBalance()
val currentAssetBalances: TokensMap = wallet.getAssetBalances()

val snapshot: BalancesSnapshot = BalancesSnapshot(currentHeight, currentBalance, currentAssetBalances)

// Save the snapshot to a database or file
database.saveSnapshot(snapshot)
```

In this example, the current height, balance, and asset balances of the wallet are retrieved using methods from the `ErgoHistory` and `wallet` objects. These values are then used to create a new `BalancesSnapshot` object. Finally, the snapshot is saved to a database or file for later use.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BalancesSnapshot` case class?
    
    The `BalancesSnapshot` case class is used to represent a snapshot of the balances and asset balances at a specific height in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What is the significance of the `TokensMap` import statement?
    
    The `TokensMap` import statement is used to import the `TokensMap` class from the `org.ergoplatform.wallet` package, which is used to represent a map of token identifiers to token amounts.

3. How is the `height` parameter in the `BalancesSnapshot` case class determined?
    
    The `height` parameter in the `BalancesSnapshot` case class is determined by the `Height` type imported from the `org.ergoplatform.nodeView.history.ErgoHistory` package, which represents the height of a block in the Ergo blockchain. The `height` parameter is set to the height of the block at which the snapshot was taken.
