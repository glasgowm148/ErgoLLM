The code defines a configuration file for the Ergo node regime. It contains a case class `NodeConfigurationSettings` that holds various settings for the node, such as the state type, whether to verify transactions, the number of blocks to keep, whether to use PoPoW bootstrap, mining-related settings, mempool settings, and more. The case class also has a method `isFullBlocksPruned` that returns true if the blockchain is pruned, false if not.

The configuration file is read using the `ValueReader` trait from the `ficus` library, which provides a convenient way to read configuration files in Scala. The `NodeConfigurationSettings` case class is read using the `nodeConfigurationReader` implicit value reader, which reads the various settings from the configuration file.

The code also defines a `CheckpointSettings` case class that holds a checkpoint height and block ID. The `CheckpointingSettingsReader` trait provides an implicit value reader for `CheckpointSettings` that reads the checkpoint height and block ID from the configuration file.

The `NodeConfigurationReaders` trait extends the `StateTypeReaders`, `CheckpointingSettingsReader`, and `ModifierIdReader` traits, which provide implicit value readers for various types used in the configuration file.

Overall, this code provides a way to configure various settings for the Ergo node regime, allowing users to customize the behavior of the node to suit their needs. For example, users can specify whether to use PoPoW bootstrap, whether to mine, and various mempool settings. The `CheckpointSettings` case class also allows users to specify a checkpoint height and block ID, which can be useful for syncing the node more quickly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CheckpointSettings` case class and how is it used in the `NodeConfigurationSettings` case class?
- The `CheckpointSettings` case class stores a height and block ID for a checkpoint, and it is an optional parameter in the `NodeConfigurationSettings` case class.
2. What is the `isFullBlocksPruned` method in the `NodeConfigurationSettings` case class used for?
- The `isFullBlocksPruned` method returns a boolean indicating whether the node is keeping all the full blocks of the blockchain or not, based on the value of the `blocksToKeep` parameter.
3. What is the purpose of the `sortingOptionReader` implicit value reader in the `NodeConfigurationReaders` trait?
- The `sortingOptionReader` implicit value reader is used to read a string value from the configuration file and convert it into a `SortingOption` enum value, which is used to sort transactions in the mempool.
