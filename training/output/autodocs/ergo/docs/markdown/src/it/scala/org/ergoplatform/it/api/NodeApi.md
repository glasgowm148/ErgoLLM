The `NodeApi` trait defines an interface for interacting with a node in the Ergo blockchain network. It provides methods for sending HTTP requests to the node and parsing the responses. The trait is implemented by classes that provide concrete implementations of the methods.

The `NodeApi` trait defines several methods for sending HTTP requests to the node, including `get`, `post`, and `postJson`. These methods take a path to the resource being requested and an optional function that can modify the request before it is sent. The `get` method sends an HTTP GET request to the specified path, while the `post` and `postJson` methods send HTTP POST requests with the specified body. The `postJson` method serializes the body to JSON before sending the request.

The `NodeApi` trait also defines several methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain network. These methods include `connectedPeers`, which returns a list of connected peers, `waitForPeers`, which waits for a specified number of peers to connect, and `waitForHeight`, which waits for the node to reach a specified block height. There are also methods for retrieving information about the node, such as `info`, which returns information about the node, and `status`, which returns the status of the node.

The `NodeApi` trait uses the `AsyncHttpClient` library to send HTTP requests to the node. It also uses the `HashedWheelTimer` class to schedule retries of failed requests. The `NodeApi` trait defines a `retrying` method that retries failed requests with a specified interval and status code.

The `NodeApi` trait defines several case classes that are used to parse JSON responses from the node. These case classes include `Peer`, which represents a connected peer, `Block`, which represents a block in the blockchain, and `NodeInfo`, which represents information about the node.

Overall, the `NodeApi` trait provides a high-level interface for interacting with a node in the Ergo blockchain network. It provides methods for sending HTTP requests to the node and parsing the responses, as well as methods for interacting with the blockchain network. The trait is implemented by classes that provide concrete implementations of the methods.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodeApi` trait and what methods does it provide?
- The `NodeApi` trait provides methods for interacting with a node's REST API, such as `get`, `post`, and `waitFor`. It also includes methods for retrieving information about the node, such as its status and connected peers.

2. What external libraries does this code depend on?
- This code depends on several external libraries, including `io.circe` for JSON encoding and decoding, `org.asynchttpclient` for making HTTP requests, and `scorex-util` for logging.

3. What is the purpose of the `retrying` method and how does it work?
- The `retrying` method is used to execute an HTTP request and retry it if it fails due to an `IOException` or `TimeoutException`. It uses a `HashedWheelTimer` to schedule retries at a specified interval, and returns a `Future` that resolves to the response of the successful request.
