The library provides a collection of network utilities and protocol implementations, including Echo, Finger, FTP, NNTP, NTP, POP3(S), SMTP(S), Telnet, and Whois. The POM file is used by Maven, a build automation tool, to manage the project's build, reporting, and documentation.\n\nThe POM file specifies the project's parent, groupId, artifactId, and version, which are essential for Maven to identify the project and its dependencies. It also provides information about the project's developers, contributors, and issue management system (Jira).\n\nThe POM file defines dependencies, such as JUnit for testing, and configures various Maven plugins for building, packaging, and generating documentation. For example, the maven-jar-plugin is configured to exclude the 'examples' folder from the binary jar, while the maven-source-plugin excludes the same folder from the source jar. The maven-surefire-plugin is configured to exclude certain test classes from the test execution.\n\nThe POM file also configures the build-helper-maven-plugin to attach the 'commons-net-ftp' and 'examples' JARs to the Maven lifecycle, ensuring they are signed and deployed as normal. The maven-javadoc-plugin is configured to exclude the 'examples' package from the Javadoc jar.\n\nAdditionally, the POM file sets up the maven-resources-plugin to copy the examples sources to the 'target/site/examples' directory during the pre-site phase. The exec-maven-plugin is configured to allow running examples from the command line using 'mvn exec:java'.\n\nIn summary, this POM file provides essential information and configurations for building, packaging, and managing the Apache Commons Net library using Maven.",
      "questions": "1. **Question**: What protocols are supported by the Apache Commons Net library?\n   **Answer**: The supported protocols include Echo, Finger, FTP, NNTP, NTP, POP3(S), SMTP(S), Telnet, and Whois.\n\n2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `commons-net-ftp` and `commons-net-examples` JARs created in the build configuration?\n   **Answer**: The `commons-net-ftp` JAR contains the FTP-specific classes and the `commons-net-examples` JAR contains the example code. These JARs are attached to the Maven lifecycle to ensure they will be signed and deployed as normal.\n\n3. **Question**: How can I run the examples using the Maven command line?\n   **Answer**: You can run the examples using the `exec:java` goal of the `exec-maven-plugin`. For example: `mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.arguments=FTPClientExample,-A,-l,hostname`."
