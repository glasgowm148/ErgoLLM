  "summary": "This file contains a set of error messages and exceptions that can be thrown by the JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) API. JAXB is a Java technology that allows Java developers to map Java classes to XML representations and vice versa. \n\nThe error messages and exceptions in this file are used to provide more detailed information to developers when something goes wrong during the JAXB process. For example, if a provider is not found, the error message \"Provider {0} not found\" will be thrown. Similarly, if a jaxb.properties file cannot be located for a specific package, the error message \"Unable to locate jaxb.properties for package {0}\" will be thrown.\n\nThese error messages and exceptions are used throughout the larger project to help developers debug issues with JAXB. For example, if a developer is trying to map a Java class to an XML representation and encounters an error, they can refer to these error messages to determine what went wrong and how to fix it.\n\nHere is an example of how one of these error messages might be used in code:\n\n```\ntry {\n    JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(MyClass.class);\n    Marshaller marshaller = context.createMarshaller();\n    marshaller.marshal(myObject, new File(\"output.xml\"));\n} catch (ProviderNotFoundException e) {\n    System.err.println(\"JAXB provider not found: \" + e.getMessage());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if the JAXB provider is not found, the error message \"JAXB provider not found: Provider {0} not found\" will be printed to the console, providing the developer with more information about the error.",
