  "summary": "This file contains CSS code for the ergo project's user interface. The code defines the layout, styling, and behavior of various UI components such as containers, cards, tables, buttons, and modals. \n\nThe code uses CSS selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. For example, the `.main-container` class sets the position and margin of a container element, while the `.info-card` class defines the appearance of an information card. The code also uses CSS variables to define and reuse color and size values throughout the project.\n\nThe file includes several media queries that adjust the layout and styling of UI components based on the screen size. For example, the `.info-modal-backdrop` and `.info-modal` classes define the appearance of a modal dialog, and their styles change when the screen width is less than 767 pixels.\n\nThe code also includes some animations and transitions to enhance the user experience. For example, the `.ergo-loader` class defines the appearance of a loading spinner, and the `.info-modal` class uses a transition to fade in and slide up the modal when it is opened.\n\nOverall, this code plays a crucial role in defining the look and feel of the ergo project's user interface. It allows developers to create consistent and visually appealing UI components that are responsive to different screen sizes and devices. Here is an example of how the code can be used to create a button:\n\n```html\n<button class=\"button m\">\n  Click me\n  <svg class=\"button__arrow\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n    <path d=\"M16.59 8.59L12 13.17l-4.59-4.58L6 10l6 6 6-6z\"></path>\n  </svg>\n</button>\n``` \n\nThis code creates a button with medium size and an arrow icon on the right side. The button has a white background, a gray border, and a shadow effect. When the button is hovered or clicked, it changes its background color and box shadow to provide feedback to the user.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ergo-loader` class?\n- The `ergo-loader` class is used to display a loading spinner in the center of the screen, with a width and height of 80px.\n\n2.

What is the purpose of the `wallet-table__icon-redo` class?\n- The `wallet-table__icon-redo` class is used to display a circular arrow icon that represents a refresh or reload action.
