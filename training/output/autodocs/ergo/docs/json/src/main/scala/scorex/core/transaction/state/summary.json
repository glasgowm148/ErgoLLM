      "summary": "The code above defines two traits, `StateFeature` and `TransactionValidation`, and an exception class `TooHighCostError`. The `StateFeature` trait is a basic trait for features supported by state representation, while the `TransactionValidation` trait is an instance that supports stateful validation of any transaction. The `TransactionValidation` trait has a method `validateWithCost` that takes an `ErgoTransaction` and a maximum transaction cost as input and returns a `Try[Int]`. The `maxTxCost` parameter is used to limit the maximum cost of a transaction, and if the transaction cost exceeds this limit, a `TooHighCostError` exception is thrown.\n\nThis code is part of the `ergo` project and is used to validate transactions in the Ergo blockchain. The `TransactionValidation` trait is implemented by other classes in the project to provide specific validation rules for different types of transactions. For example, there may be a class that implements `TransactionValidation` for coinbase transactions, another for regular transactions, and so on.\n\nHere is an example of how the `TransactionValidation` trait may be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nimport org.ergoplatform.modifiers.mempool.ErgoTransaction\nimport scorex.core.transaction.state.TransactionValidation\n\nclass RegularTransactionValidation extends TransactionValidation {\n  override def validateWithCost(tx: ErgoTransaction, maxTxCost: Int): Try[Int] = {\n    // Perform validation logic for regular transactions\n    // ...\n    // If transaction is valid, return the transaction cost\n    Try(tx.cost)\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nval tx = ErgoTransaction(...)\nval maxTxCost = 1000\nval validator = new RegularTransactionValidation()\nval result = validator.validateWithCost(tx, maxTxCost)\nresult match {\n  case Success(cost) => println(s\"Transaction is valid with cost $cost\")\n  case Failure(e) => println(s\"Transaction is invalid: ${e.getMessage}\")\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, we create a new instance of `RegularTransactionValidation` and use it to validate a transaction `tx` with a maximum cost of `maxTxCost`. If the transaction is valid, the `validateWithCost` method returns a `Success` with the transaction cost, which is then printed to the console. If the transaction is invalid, a `Failure` is returned with an error message, which is also printed to the console.",
