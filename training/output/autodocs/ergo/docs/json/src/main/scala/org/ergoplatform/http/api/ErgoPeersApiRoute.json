  "summary": "The `ErgoPeersApiRoute` class is an API route for managing peers in the Ergo blockchain network. It provides several endpoints for retrieving information about connected peers, blacklisted peers, and the status of the P2P layer. It also allows for connecting to new peers.\n\nThe `ErgoPeersApiRoute` class extends the `ApiRoute` trait and overrides its `route` method to define the API endpoints. The endpoints are defined using the `path` directive from the Akka HTTP library. The `pathPrefix` directive is used to group the endpoints under the `/peers` path.\n\nThe `syncInfo` and `trackInfo` endpoints return information about the synchronization and delivery tracking of the Ergo node, respectively. The `allPeers` endpoint returns information about all known peers in the network. The `connectedPeers` endpoint returns information about all currently connected peers. The `peersStatus` endpoint returns the status of the P2P layer, including the time of the last incoming message and the network time obtained from an NTP server. The `blacklistedPeers` endpoint returns a list of all blacklisted peers.\n\nThe `connect` endpoint allows for connecting to a new peer by sending a `ConnectTo` message to the `networkController` actor. The endpoint expects a JSON object containing the address and port of the peer to connect to.\n\nThe `PeerInfoResponse` case class is used to represent information about a peer in the API responses. It includes the peer's address, last message time, last handshake time, name, connection type, and REST API URL. The `PeersStatusResponse` case class is used to represent the response of the `peersStatus` endpoint. The `BlacklistedPeers` case class is used to represent the response of the `blacklistedPeers` endpoint.\n\nThe `ErgoPeersApiRoute` object provides factory methods for creating instances of the `ErgoPeersApiRoute` class. It also defines the `PeerInfoResponse`, `PeersStatusResponse`, and `BlacklistedPeers` case classes, as well as their corresponding Circe encoders.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines an API route for managing peers in the Ergo platform.\n\n2.
