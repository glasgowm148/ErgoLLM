  "summary": "The `ExtensionValidator` class is used to validate an `Extension` object based on the current `ErgoValidationSettings`. The `Extension` object is a modifier in the Ergo blockchain that extends the header of a block. It contains a set of key-value pairs that can be used to store additional data. The purpose of this class is to ensure that the `Extension` object is valid and conforms to certain rules.\n\nThe `validateExtension` method takes an `Extension` object, a `Header` object, an optional previous `ExtensionCandidate`, and an optional previous `Header`. It then calls the `validateInterlinks` method to validate the interlinks of the `Extension` object. The method then performs several validation checks on the `Extension` object using the `ValidationState` object. These checks include validating the length of the keys and values, checking for duplicate keys, and ensuring that the `Extension` object is not empty. If any of these checks fail, an `InvalidModifier` object is returned.\n\nThe `validateInterlinks` method is used to validate the interlinks of the `Extension` object. Interlinks are used in the Non-Interactive Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoW) protocol to link blocks together. The method takes the current `Extension` object, the current `Header` object, the previous `ExtensionCandidate`, and the previous `Header`. It then unpacks the interlinks from the previous `ExtensionCandidate` and the current `Extension` object. It then calculates the expected interlinks based on the previous `Header` and the previous interlinks. If the expected interlinks match the current interlinks, the method returns a `ValidationState` object. If the expected interlinks do not match the current interlinks, an `InvalidModifier` object is returned.\n\nOverall, the `ExtensionValidator` class is an important part of the Ergo blockchain validation process. It ensures that `Extension` objects are valid and conform to certain rules. It also validates the interlinks of the `Extension` object, which are important for the NIPoPoW protocol. This class can be used in the larger project to validate `Extension` objects and ensure the integrity of the Ergo blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExtensionValidator` class?\n- The `ExtensionValidator` class implements extension validation based on current `ErgoValidationSettings`.\n\n2. What are the parameters of the `validateExtension` method?\n- The `validateExtension` method takes in an `Extension` object, a `Header` object, an optional `ExtensionCandidate` object, and an optional `Header` object.\n\n3. What is the role of the `validateInterlinks` method?\n- The `validateInterlinks` method validates the interlinks of the extension by comparing them with the previous extension and header."
