The `PrunedDigestNodeSyncSpec` class is a test suite that verifies the synchronization of a pruned digest node with a mining node. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the pruned digest node can synchronize with the mining node up to a certain height, without loading full blocks that should be pruned. 

The test scenario consists of the following steps:
1. Start a mining node and let it mine a chain of length approximately equal to `approxTargetHeight`.
2. Shut down the mining node, restart it with mining turned off, and fetch its info to get the actual `targetHeight`.
3. Start a digest node and wait until it gets synced with the mining node up to `targetHeight`, ensuring it does not load full blocks that should be pruned.
4. Fetch the digest node info and compare it with the mining node's info.
5. Make sure the digest node does not store full blocks with height less than `targetHeight - blocksToKeep`.

The `PrunedDigestNodeSyncSpec` class extends the `AnyFlatSpec` class and uses the `IntegrationSuite` trait. It defines several variables, including `approxTargetHeight`, `blocksToKeep`, `localVolume`, `remoteVolume`, `dir`, `minerConfig`, `nodeForSyncingConfig`, and `digestConfig`. It also defines a test case using the `it should` syntax, which verifies the synchronization of the pruned digest node with the mining node.

The `PrunedDigestNodeSyncSpec` class uses several classes and methods from other packages, including `java.io.File`, `akka.japi.Option.Some`, `com.typesafe.config.Config`, `org.asynchttpclient.util.HttpConstants`, `org.ergoplatform.it.container.{IntegrationSuite, Node}`, and `scala.async.Async`. It also uses several methods from the `docker` object, including `startDevNetNode`, `stopNode`, `waitForHeight`, `info`, `headers`, `waitFor`, and `singleGet`.

Overall, the `PrunedDigestNodeSyncSpec` class is an important part of the `ergo` project, as it ensures that the pruned digest node can synchronize with the mining node up to a certain height, without loading full blocks that should be pruned. This is essential for the proper functioning of the `ergo` blockchain, as it ensures that the pruned digest node can operate efficiently and securely.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code is a test scenario for pruned digest node synchronization. It tests the synchronization of two nodes up to a certain height, ensuring that the digest node does not load full blocks that should be pruned.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several dependencies, including `java.io.File`, `akka.japi.Option.Some`, `com.typesafe.config.Config`, `org.asynchttpclient.util.HttpConstants`, `org.ergoplatform.it.container.{IntegrationSuite, Node}`, and `org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec`.

3. What is the testing scenario for this code?
- The testing scenario involves starting up a mining node, shutting it down, restarting it with mining turned off, and fetching its info to get the actual target height. Then, a digest node is started and synced with the first node up to the target height, ensuring it does not load full blocks that should be pruned. The digest node info is then compared with the first node's info, and it is ensured that the digest node does not store full blocks with height less than the target height minus the number of blocks to keep.
