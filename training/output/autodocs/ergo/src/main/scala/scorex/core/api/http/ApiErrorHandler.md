The `ApiErrorHandler` object in the `scorex.core.api.http` package is responsible for handling exceptions that may occur during the execution of the API. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized way of handling exceptions that may occur in the API, making it easier to manage and debug errors.

The `ApiErrorHandler` object defines an implicit `ExceptionHandler` that takes a `NonFatal` exception and returns an `ApiError`. The `NonFatal` exception is a superclass of all exceptions that are not fatal, meaning that they can be caught and handled. The `ApiError` is a custom error class that is defined elsewhere in the project.

This code can be used in the larger project by simply importing the `ApiErrorHandler` object and using the implicit `ExceptionHandler` defined within it. For example, if an exception occurs in an API endpoint, the `ExceptionHandler` will catch it and return an `ApiError` instead of crashing the application. This makes it easier to manage errors and provide a better user experience.

Here is an example of how this code can be used:

```scala
import scorex.core.api.http.ApiErrorHandler.exceptionHandler

val route = path("example") {
  // API endpoint code that may throw an exception
}

// Use the implicit exception handler defined in ApiErrorHandler
val handledRoute = handleExceptions(exceptionHandler)(route)
```

In this example, the `handleExceptions` directive is used to wrap the API endpoint code with the `exceptionHandler` defined in `ApiErrorHandler`. If an exception occurs in the endpoint code, the `exceptionHandler` will catch it and return an `ApiError`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ApiErrorHandler` object?
   - The `ApiErrorHandler` object provides an implicit `ExceptionHandler` that handles non-fatal exceptions by returning an `ApiError`.

2. What is the `ApiError` class and where is it defined?
   - The code snippet does not provide information on the `ApiError` class or its definition. It is possible that it is defined in another file within the `ergo` project.

3. How is the `exceptionHandler` used in the project?
   - The `exceptionHandler` is an implicit value that can be used by other parts of the project to handle non-fatal exceptions. It is likely that it is used in conjunction with the Akka HTTP server to handle exceptions that occur during HTTP requests.
