The `ModifierValidator` object and `ValidationState` class are part of the `ergo` project and provide a validation DSL for the modifier validation process. The `ModifierValidator` object contains helper methods for the validation process, while the `ValidationState` class contains the validation DSL.

The `ModifierValidator` object has a method `apply` that takes a `ValidationSettings` object and returns a `ValidationState` object. The `ValidationState` object is used to create the next validation state as the result of a given operation. The `ModifierValidator` object also has several methods that report recoverable and non-recoverable modifier errors that could be fixed by later retries or require modifier change. The object also has a method `invalid` that wraps semantic validity to the validation state.

The `ValidationState` class contains the validation DSL. It has methods that create the next validation state as the result of a given operation, replace payload with the new one, map payload if validation is successful, validate the condition is true or else return the error given, validate the first argument equals the second, validate the ids are equal, wrap semantic validity to the validation state, validate the condition is Success, validate the block doesn't throw an Exception, validate operation against payload is Valid or else return the error, validate condition against payload is true or else return the error, validate operation against option value if it's not None, validate condition against option value if it's not None, and validate elements of a given collection.

The `ValidationState` class is used to create a validation state and then perform multiple checks for the same object without any transformation. The class is designed to perform multiple checks for the same object without any transformation. The class is used in the Ergo `org.ergoplatform.nodeView.history.storage.modifierprocessors.HeadersProcessor.HeaderValidator` and other examples could also be found in `scorex.core.validation.ValidationSpec`. The class supports both fail-fast and error-accumulating validation while cats `Validated` supports only accumulative approach.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ModifierValidator` object?
- The `ModifierValidator` object provides helpers for the modifier validation process, including methods for reporting recoverable and non-recoverable modifier errors.

2. What is the purpose of the `ValidationState` case class?
- The `ValidationState` case class is used to create the next validation state as the result of a given operation. It also provides methods for validating conditions and payloads, and for accumulating errors.

3. What is the difference between a recoverable and non-recoverable modifier error?
- A recoverable modifier error can be fixed by later retries, while a non-recoverable modifier error cannot be fixed by retries and requires a modifier change.
