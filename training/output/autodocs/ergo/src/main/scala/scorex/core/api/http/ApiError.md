The `ApiError` object in this code is used to handle HTTP errors in the ergo project's API. It takes in a `StatusCode` and an optional `reason` string, and provides methods to generate an appropriate HTTP response for the error. 

The `complete` method generates a JSON response with the error status code, reason, and an optional detail message. It then creates an HTTP entity with the JSON response and returns a `Route` that completes with the entity and status code. 

The `defaultRoute` method is a convenience method that calls `complete` with no detail message. The `apply` method is a convenience method that calls `complete` with a detail message. 

The `ApiError` object also provides several pre-defined error types as `object`s, such as `InternalError`, `InvalidJson`, `BadRequest`, etc. These objects are instances of `ApiError` with pre-defined status codes and reasons. 

The `toRoute` method is an implicit conversion that allows an `ApiError` object to be used directly as a `Route`. This allows for easy integration with the Akka HTTP server. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and flexible way to handle HTTP errors in the ergo project's API. Here is an example usage of the `ApiError` object:

```scala
val route: Route = path("example") {
  get {
    // some logic that may throw an exception
    try {
      // ...
    } catch {
      case e: Exception => ApiError.InternalError(e)
    }
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ApiError` case class?
- The `ApiError` case class is used to create HTTP error responses with a given status code and reason.

2. What is the purpose of the `apply` methods in the `ApiError` object?
- The `apply` methods in the `ApiError` object are used to create HTTP error responses with a default status code and reason based on the type of error passed in.

3. What is the purpose of the `toRoute` method in the `ApiError` object?
- The `toRoute` method in the `ApiError` object is used to implicitly convert an `ApiError` instance to an Akka HTTP `Route` instance, which can be used to handle HTTP requests and send HTTP responses.
