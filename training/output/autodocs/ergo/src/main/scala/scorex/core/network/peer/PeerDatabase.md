The `PeerDatabase` class is a component of the Ergo project that provides an in-memory implementation of a peer database. The class is responsible for managing the list of known peers, blacklisting peers that misbehave, and penalizing peers that violate network rules. 

The class has several private variables that store information about peers, including a map of known peers, a map of blacklisted peers, and a map of penalized peers. The class also has a reference to a persistent key-value store that is used to store peer information. 

The `PeerDatabase` class provides several public methods that allow other components of the Ergo project to interact with the peer database. These methods include:

- `get(peer: InetSocketAddress): Option[PeerInfo]`: Returns the `PeerInfo` object for a given peer address.
- `addOrUpdateKnownPeer(peerInfo: PeerInfo): Unit`: Adds or updates the `PeerInfo` object for a known peer.
- `addToBlacklist(socketAddress: InetSocketAddress, penaltyType: PenaltyType): Unit`: Adds a peer to the blacklist for a specified duration.
- `removeFromBlacklist(address: InetAddress): Unit`: Removes a peer from the blacklist.
- `remove(address: InetSocketAddress): Unit`: Removes a peer from the list of known peers.
- `knownPeers: Map[InetSocketAddress, PeerInfo]`: Returns a map of all known peers.
- `blacklistedPeers: Seq[InetAddress]`: Returns a sequence of all blacklisted peers.
- `isEmpty: Boolean`: Returns `true` if the list of known peers is empty, `false` otherwise.
- `isBlacklisted(address: InetAddress): Boolean`: Returns `true` if a peer is blacklisted, `false` otherwise.
- `isBlacklisted(address: InetSocketAddress): Boolean`: Returns `true` if a peer is blacklisted, `false` otherwise.
- `penalize(socketAddress: InetSocketAddress, penaltyType: PenaltyType): Boolean`: Registers a new penalty in the penalty book and returns `true` if the penalty threshold is reached, `false` otherwise.
- `penaltyScore(address: InetAddress): Int`: Returns the currently accumulated penalty score for a given address.
- `penaltyScore(socketAddress: InetSocketAddress): Int`: Returns the currently accumulated penalty score for a given socket address.

The `PeerDatabase` class also has several private methods that are used internally. These methods include:

- `serialize(obj: Object): Array[Byte]`: Serializes an object using the standard Java serializer.
- `deserialize(bytes: Array[Byte]): Object`: Deserializes an object using the standard Java serializer.
- `loadPeers: Try[Map[InetSocketAddress, PeerInfo]]`: Loads peers from the persistent key-value store.
- `checkBanned(address: InetAddress, bannedTill: Long): Boolean`: Checks if a peer is still blacklisted.
- `penaltyScore(penaltyType: PenaltyType): Int`: Returns the penalty score for a given penalty type.
- `penaltyDuration(penalty: PenaltyType): Long`: Returns the duration of a penalty for a given penalty type.

Overall, the `PeerDatabase` class provides an important component of the Ergo project that manages the list of known peers, blacklists misbehaving peers, and penalizes peers that violate network rules.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerDatabase` class?
- The `PeerDatabase` class is an in-memory peer database implementation that supports temporal blacklisting.

2. How does the `PeerDatabase` class handle serialization and deserialization of objects?
- The `PeerDatabase` class uses standard Java serializer to serialize and deserialize objects.

3. What is the penalty book in the `PeerDatabase` class used for?
- The penalty book in the `PeerDatabase` class is used to keep track of penalized peers' accumulated penalty score and last penalty timestamp.
