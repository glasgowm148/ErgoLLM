The `ScorexSettings` object is responsible for reading and parsing configuration files for the `ergo` project. It contains case classes for `LoggingSettings`, `RESTApiSettings`, `NetworkSettings`, and `ScorexSettings`. 

The `LoggingSettings` case class contains a single field for the logging level. 

The `RESTApiSettings` case class contains fields for the bind address, API key hash, CORS allowed origin, timeout, and public URL. 

The `NetworkSettings` case class contains fields for the node name, added maximum delay, local only, known peers, bind address, maximum connections, connection timeout, UPnP enabled, UPnP gateway timeout, UPnP discover timeout, declared address, handshake timeout, delivery timeout, maximum delivery checks, application version, agent name, desired inventory objects, synchronization interval, synchronization status refresh, stable synchronization interval, stable synchronization status refresh, inactive connection deadline, synchronization timeout, controller timeout, maximum modifiers cache size, magic bytes, get peers interval, maximum peer specification objects, temporal ban duration, penalty safe interval, penalty score threshold, peer eviction interval, and peer discovery. 

The `ScorexSettings` case class contains fields for the data directory, log directory, logging settings, network settings, and REST API settings. 

The `ScorexSettings` object also contains methods for reading configuration files. The `readConfigFromPath` method takes an optional user configuration file path and a configuration path and returns a `Config` object. It first attempts to read the user configuration file, falling back to the default configuration if none is provided. The `read` method takes an optional user configuration file path and returns a `ScorexSettings` object parsed from the configuration file. The `fromConfig` method takes a `Config` object and returns a `ScorexSettings` object parsed from the configuration. 

Overall, the `ScorexSettings` object is a crucial component of the `ergo` project, as it allows for easy configuration of various settings related to logging, the REST API, and the network. It provides a simple interface for reading and parsing configuration files, making it easy to customize the project for different use cases. 

Example usage:
```
val settings = ScorexSettings.read(Some("my_config.conf"))
println(settings.network.nodeName) // prints the name of the node
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScorexSettings` class?
- The `ScorexSettings` class is used to store various settings related to the `ergo` project, such as logging, network, and REST API settings.

2. What is the purpose of the `readConfigFromPath` method?
- The `readConfigFromPath` method is used to read a configuration file from a given path, and handle overrides and fallbacks for different types of configurations.

3. What is the purpose of the `fromConfig` method?
- The `fromConfig` method is used to create a `ScorexSettings` object from a given `Config` object, using the `configPath` as a reference for the configuration keys. It also ensures that the `magicBytes` field in the `network` settings has the correct length.
