The `LoggingUtil` object in the `org.ergoplatform.utils` package provides a method called `getReasonMsg` that takes in a `Throwable` object and returns a string message. The purpose of this method is to extract a human-readable message from the `Throwable` object that can be used for logging or debugging purposes. 

The method first checks if the `Throwable` object has a message associated with it using the `getMessage` method. If a message exists, it is concatenated with the name of the `Throwable` class and returned as a string. If no message exists, only the name of the `Throwable` class is returned as a string. 

This method can be used throughout the larger project to provide more informative error messages when exceptions are thrown. For example, if an exception is caught in a method, the `getReasonMsg` method can be called to extract a more detailed message about the exception and log it for debugging purposes. 

Here is an example usage of the `getReasonMsg` method:

```scala
try {
  // some code that may throw an exception
} catch {
  case e: Exception => 
    val errorMsg = LoggingUtil.getReasonMsg(e)
    logger.error(errorMsg)
}
```

In this example, if an exception is caught, the `getReasonMsg` method is called with the caught `Exception` object to extract a message. The message is then logged using a logger object. 

Overall, the `LoggingUtil` object provides a useful utility method for extracting error messages from `Throwable` objects in the `ergo` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoggingUtil` object?
   - The `LoggingUtil` object likely contains utility functions related to logging.
2. What does the `getReasonMsg` function do?
   - The `getReasonMsg` function takes in a `Throwable` object and returns a formatted string containing the class name and message of the `Throwable`, or just the class name if the message is null.
3. Why does the `getReasonMsg` function use `Option` and `map`?
   - The `Option` and `map` are used to safely handle the possibility of a null message in the `Throwable` object, and to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.
