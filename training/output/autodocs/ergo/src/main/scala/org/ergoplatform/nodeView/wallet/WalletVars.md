The `WalletVars` class is an inner class of the wallet actor in the Ergo platform. It encapsulates the mutable state of the wallet actor, making modifications of this part of the internal state explicit and unit-testable. The class contains several fields and methods that allow for the manipulation of the wallet's state.

The `WalletVars` class has several fields that store information about the wallet's state. These fields include `proverOpt`, which is an optional `ErgoProvingInterpreter` that represents the wallet's prover. The `externalScans` field is a sequence of `Scan` objects that represent external scans that the wallet is performing. The `stateCacheProvided` field is an optional `WalletCache` object that represents the wallet's state cache.

The `WalletVars` class has several methods that allow for the manipulation of the wallet's state. The `removeScan` method removes a scan from the `externalScans` sequence. The `addScan` method adds a scan to the `externalScans` sequence. The `resetProver` method clears the prover along with its secrets. The `withProver` method sets the prover to a new `ErgoProvingInterpreter`. The `withExtendedKey` method adds a new secret to the prover. The `withParameters` method updates the parameters of the prover.

The `WalletVars` object has a factory method that creates a new `WalletVars` object from a `WalletStorage` object and an `ErgoSettings` object. The `WalletStorage` object represents the wallet's storage, and the `ErgoSettings` object represents the wallet's settings. The factory method reads all the keys from the storage and creates a new `WalletCache` object if the keys are not empty. Otherwise, it returns a `None` value for the `WalletCache` object.

Overall, the `WalletVars` class and object provide a way to manage the mutable state of the wallet actor in the Ergo platform. It allows for the manipulation of the wallet's state in a controlled and testable manner.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WalletVars` class?
- The `WalletVars` class encapsulates the mutable state of the wallet actor and makes modifications of this part of the internal state explicit and unit-testable.

2. What is the `proverOpt` parameter used for?
- The `proverOpt` parameter is an optional `ErgoProvingInterpreter` instance used to add new secrets to the prover, update the prover's parameters, and clear the prover along with its secrets.

3. What is the purpose of the `stateCacheOpt` parameter?
- The `stateCacheOpt` parameter is an optional `WalletCache` instance used to cache wallet state information such as tracked public keys, public key addresses, tracked bytes, mining scripts bytes, and a Bloom filter of script bytes.
