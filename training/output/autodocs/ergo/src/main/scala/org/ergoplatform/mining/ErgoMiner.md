The `ErgoMiner` class is responsible for initializing the mining process in the Ergo blockchain. It is an Akka actor that communicates with other actors in the system to generate candidate blocks for mining. The purpose of this class is to handle the complex initialization logic required for mining, including obtaining the necessary secrets and public keys from the wallet, and starting the mining process when all the required information is available.

The `ErgoMiner` class is initialized with an instance of `ErgoSettings`, `ActorRef` instances for the `viewHolder` and `readersHolder`, and an optional `secretKeyOpt`. The `viewHolder` and `readersHolder` actors are used to obtain data from the current blockchain state, while the `secretKeyOpt` is used to initialize the miner's state with the secrets required for mining. If the `secretKeyOpt` is not provided, the miner will attempt to obtain it from the wallet.

The `ErgoMiner` class has three main states: `preStart`, `starting`, and `started`. In the `preStart` state, the miner attempts to obtain the necessary secrets and public keys from the wallet or the configuration file. If the secrets and public keys are not available, the miner waits for a specified period before retrying. If the secrets and public keys are available, the miner transitions to the `starting` state.

In the `starting` state, the miner waits for a signal to start mining. This signal can come from the `ErgoApp` or from the application of a new block to the blockchain. Once the signal is received, the miner starts the mining process by creating an instance of `ErgoMiningThread` for each internal miner. The `ErgoMiningThread` communicates with the `CandidateGenerator` actor to generate candidate blocks for mining.

In the `started` state, the miner is actively mining and can receive requests from external miners to generate candidate blocks. The `ErgoMiner` actor forwards these requests to the `CandidateGenerator` actor for processing.

Overall, the `ErgoMiner` class is an important component of the Ergo blockchain that handles the complex initialization logic required for mining. It communicates with other actors in the system to generate candidate blocks for mining and provides an interface for external miners to request candidate blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is responsible for complex mining initialization logic in the Ergo platform. It forwards requests of external miner to CandidateGenerator and boots up ErgoMiningThread which talks to CandidateGenerator directly.

2. What are the dependencies of this code file?
- This code file depends on several other packages and classes such as akka.actor, org.ergoplatform.mining.CandidateGenerator, org.ergoplatform.nodeView.state.DigestState, org.ergoplatform.modifiers.history.header.Header, org.ergoplatform.nodeView.wallet.ErgoWalletActor, org.ergoplatform.settings.ErgoSettings, org.ergoplatform.nodeView.ErgoNodeViewHolder.ReceivableMessages.GetDataFromCurrentView, org.ergoplatform.network.ErgoNodeViewSynchronizer.ReceivableMessages.FullBlockApplied, scorex.util.ScorexLogging, and sigmastate.basics.DLogProtocol.

3. What is the role of the ErgoMiner class in the Ergo platform?
- The ErgoMiner class is responsible for complex mining initialization logic in the Ergo platform. It forwards requests of external miner to CandidateGenerator and boots up ErgoMiningThread which talks to CandidateGenerator directly. It also initializes miner state with secrets and candidate generator, and bridges between external miner and CandidateGenerator.
