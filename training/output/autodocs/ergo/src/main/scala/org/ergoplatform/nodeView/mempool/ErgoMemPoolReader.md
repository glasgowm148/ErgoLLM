The `ErgoMemPoolReader` trait is a part of the `ergo` project and provides an interface for reading data from the Ergo transaction mempool. The mempool is a data structure that holds unconfirmed transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block. The purpose of this trait is to provide methods for querying the mempool to obtain information about the transactions it contains.

The `ErgoMemPoolReader` trait defines several methods for querying the mempool. The `contains` method takes a transaction ID as input and returns `true` if the mempool contains the transaction or if it has been invalidated earlier, and `false` otherwise. The `getAll` method returns all unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, while the `getAll(ids: Seq[ModifierId])` method returns a sequence of unconfirmed transactions corresponding to the given transaction IDs. The `size` method returns the number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool.

The `spentInputs` method returns an iterator over the box IDs of inputs spent by the transactions in the mempool. The `getAllPrioritized` method returns all transactions in the mempool sorted by weight in descending order. The `take(limit: Int)` method returns a sequence of up to `limit` transactions sorted by weight in descending order. The `random(limit: Int)` method returns a sequence of up to `limit` transactions chosen randomly from the mempool.

The `modifierById(modifierId: ModifierId)` method returns the transaction corresponding to the given transaction ID, or `None` if the transaction is not in the mempool. The `weightedTransactionIds(limit: Int)` method returns a sequence of up to `limit` transaction IDs with weights, where the weight of a transaction is determined by the fee it pays. The transactions are sorted by weight in descending order.

The `getExpectedWaitTime(txFee: Long, txSize: Int)` method takes a transaction fee and size as input and returns the expected wait time in milliseconds for the transaction to be included in a block. The `getRecommendedFee(expectedWaitTimeMinutes: Int, txSize: Int)` method takes a maximum expected wait time and transaction size as input and returns a recommended fee value for the transaction to be included in the mempool within the specified time.

Overall, the `ErgoMemPoolReader` trait provides a set of methods for querying the Ergo transaction mempool to obtain information about the unconfirmed transactions it contains. These methods can be used by other components of the `ergo` project to implement functionality related to transaction processing and fee estimation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a trait called `ErgoMemPoolReader` which provides methods for interacting with a mempool of unconfirmed transactions in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What methods are available for interacting with the mempool?
- The `ErgoMemPoolReader` trait provides methods for checking if a transaction is in the mempool, getting all transactions in the mempool, getting prioritized and random subsets of transactions, and getting information about transaction fees and expected wait times.

3. How are transactions sorted in the mempool?
- Transactions in the mempool are sorted by weight, which is determined by the fee that the transaction is paying. The `weightedTransactionIds` method returns a sequence of transaction ids with their corresponding weights, sorted in descending order by weight.
