The `ErgoMiningThread` class is a Scala implementation of a miner that uses only CPU. It is designed to mimic the behavior of a GPU miner by polling for new candidates and submitting solutions. However, it is only useful for low mining difficulty, as its hashrate is just 1000 h/s.

The class takes three parameters: `ergoSettings`, `candidateGenerator`, and `sk`. `ergoSettings` is an instance of `ErgoSettings`, which contains various settings related to the Ergo blockchain. `candidateGenerator` is an `ActorRef` that generates new candidates for mining. `sk` is a `PrivateKey` used for mining.

The class extends the `Actor` trait and uses the `ScorexLogging` trait for logging. It defines a `powScheme` variable that is set to the proof-of-work scheme specified in `ergoSettings.chainSettings.powScheme`. It also defines a constant `NonceStep` that is used to increment the nonce value during mining.

The `preStart` method is called when the actor is started. It logs a message indicating that the miner thread is starting and schedules a periodic task to poll for new candidates. The `postStop` method is called when the actor is stopped and logs a message indicating that the miner thread is stopping.

The `receive` method is the main message handler for the actor. It receives messages of type `StatusReply.Success` and `StatusReply.Error` from the `candidateGenerator` actor. When a new candidate is received, the `receive` method logs a message indicating that block mining is being initiated and becomes the `mining` method. When an error occurs, it logs an error message. When a solution is accepted, it logs a message indicating that the solution has been accepted and increments the `solvedBlocksCount`. When a `MineCmd` message is received, it attempts to find a solution by calling the `proveCandidate` method of the `powScheme` object. If a solution is found, it logs a message indicating that a solution has been found and sends the proof-of-work solution to the `candidateGenerator` actor. If a solution is not found, it logs a message indicating that it is trying a new nonce value and becomes the `mining` method with the new nonce value.

The `mining` method is called when a new candidate is received and is responsible for mining the candidate. It receives messages of type `StatusReply.Success`, `StatusReply.Error`, and `MineCmd`. When a new candidate is received, it checks if it is different from the current candidate and starts mining it if it is. When an error occurs, it logs an error message. When a solution is accepted, it logs a message indicating that the solution has been accepted and increments the `solvedBlocksCount`. When a `MineCmd` message is received, it attempts to find a solution by calling the `proveCandidate` method of the `powScheme` object. If a solution is found, it logs a message indicating that a solution has been found and sends the proof-of-work solution to the `candidateGenerator` actor. If a solution is not found, it logs a message indicating that it is trying a new nonce value and becomes the `mining` method with the new nonce value.

The `ErgoMiningThread` object defines a `props` method that creates a new instance of the `ErgoMiningThread` class with the specified parameters. It also defines an `apply` method that creates a new actor with a random name and the specified parameters. The object also defines three case classes: `MineCmd`, `GetSolvedBlocksCount`, and `SolvedBlocksCount`. `MineCmd` is used to initiate mining, `GetSolvedBlocksCount` is used to get the number of solved blocks, and `SolvedBlocksCount` is used to return the number of solved blocks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoMiningThread` class?
- The `ErgoMiningThread` class is a CPU miner implementation that mimics the behavior of a GPU miner in terms of polling for new candidates and submitting solutions.

2. What external dependencies does the `ErgoMiningThread` class have?
- The `ErgoMiningThread` class depends on the `ActorRef` and `Props` classes from the Akka library, as well as the `ErgoSettings` and `PrivateKey` classes from the Ergo platform.

3. What is the role of the `powScheme` variable in the `ErgoMiningThread` class?
- The `powScheme` variable holds the proof-of-work scheme used by the Ergo platform, which is used to prove the validity of a candidate block solution.
