The `UtxoState` class in this code is an implementation of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set for the Ergo platform. It maintains the state of unspent transaction outputs using an authenticated AVL+ tree, which is a data structure that allows efficient and secure verification of the UTXO set's contents.

The `UtxoState` class extends the `ErgoState` trait, which provides methods for transaction validation and state modification. It also implements the `UtxoStateReader` trait, which allows reading the UTXO set's contents.

The constructor of the `UtxoState` class takes four parameters: `persistentProver`, `version`, `store`, and `constants`. The `persistentProver` is an instance of `PersistentBatchAVLProver`, which is responsible for building and updating the authenticated AVL+ tree. The `version` parameter represents the current state version, while the `store` parameter is an instance of `LDBVersionedStore`, which is used for storing the persistent prover's data and metadata. The `constants` parameter contains constants that do not change with state version changes.

The `applyModifier` method is used to apply a block section (either a full block or a header) to the UTXO state. When a full block is applied, the method updates the state by applying the transactions in the block, generating a new state root, and updating the metadata in the store. If the block is a header, the method updates the state context with the header information.

The `rollbackTo` method allows rolling back the UTXO state to a previous version by providing the version tag. This is useful in case of a blockchain reorganization.

The `UtxoState` object provides utility methods for creating a new UTXO state from a `BoxHolder` (a collection of unspent transaction outputs) and a directory for storing the state data. This is useful for initializing the UTXO state during the genesis block creation or for testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `UtxoState` class?**

   The `UtxoState` class is an implementation of the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) set for the Ergo platform. It manages the state of unspent transaction outputs using an authenticated AVL+ tree and provides methods for applying and rolling back transactions and modifiers.

2. **How does the `applyTransactions` method work?**

   The `applyTransactions` method takes a sequence of transactions, a header ID, an expected digest, and a current state context as input. It processes the transactions, updates the state of the UTXO set, and validates the resulting state against the expected digest. If the processing is successful, it returns a `Try[Unit]` indicating success; otherwise, it returns a failure with an error message.

3. **How does the `rollbackTo` method work?**

   The `rollbackTo` method takes a version tag as input and attempts to roll back the UTXO state to the specified version. It does this by looking up the root hash for the given version in the store and then rolling back the persistent prover to that root hash. If successful, it returns a new `UtxoState` instance with the rolled-back state; otherwise, it returns a failure with an error message.
