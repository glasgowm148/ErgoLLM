The `StateConstants` class is a part of the `ergo` project and is used to define constants that do not change when the state version changes. This class takes in a `ErgoSettings` object as a parameter and uses it to define the constants. 

The `keepVersions` constant is defined as the value of `settings.nodeSettings.keepVersions`. This value represents the number of previous versions of the state that are kept in the database. 

The `votingSettings` constant is defined as the value of `settings.chainSettings.voting`. This value represents the voting settings for the blockchain. 

The `genesisStateDigest` constant is defined as the value of `settings.chainSettings.genesisStateDigest`. This value represents the digest of the genesis state of the blockchain. 

This class can be used in the larger project to define constants that are used throughout the codebase. For example, the `keepVersions` constant can be used to determine how many previous versions of the state are kept in the database. The `votingSettings` constant can be used to determine the voting settings for the blockchain. The `genesisStateDigest` constant can be used to verify the genesis state of the blockchain. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:

```
val ergoSettings = ErgoSettings.load()
val stateConstants = StateConstants(ergoSettings)

val numVersionsToKeep = stateConstants.keepVersions
println(s"Keeping $numVersionsToKeep versions of the state in the database")

val votingSettings = stateConstants.votingSettings
println(s"Voting settings: $votingSettings")

val genesisStateDigest = stateConstants.genesisStateDigest
println(s"Genesis state digest: $genesisStateDigest")
```

In this example, we load the `ErgoSettings` object and use it to create a `StateConstants` object. We then use the constants defined in the `StateConstants` object to print out information about the blockchain, such as the number of versions of the state that are kept in the database, the voting settings, and the genesis state digest.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StateConstants` class?
- The `StateConstants` class holds constants that do not change when state version changes, and takes in node settings as a parameter.

2. What are the `keepVersions` and `votingSettings` variables used for?
- `keepVersions` is a variable that holds the number of versions of the state to keep, while `votingSettings` holds the voting settings for the chain.

3. What is the `genesisStateDigest` variable used for?
- The `genesisStateDigest` variable holds the digest of the genesis state for the chain.
