The code provided is a CSS file that contains styles for various components used in the ergo project. The purpose of this code is to define the visual appearance of the user interface elements in the project. 

The code defines styles for various components such as the main container, sidebar, navbar, toast notifications, info cards, loader, dashboard, backdrop, wallet table, and buttons. These styles define the layout, positioning, colors, fonts, and other visual properties of these components.

For example, the `.main-container` class defines the position, margin, and size of the main container element. The `.sidebar` class defines the position, height, width, and border of the sidebar element. The `.navbar` class defines the background color, text color, and alignment of the navbar element.

The code also defines styles for various states of the components, such as success and error states for toast notifications and info cards. It also defines responsive styles for smaller screen sizes.

These styles can be used in the larger project to ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface. Developers can apply these styles to the appropriate components in their code to achieve the desired visual appearance. For example, a developer can apply the `.wallet-table` class to a table element to give it the defined border and padding styles.

Overall, this code plays an important role in defining the visual appearance of the ergo project and ensuring a consistent user interface.
