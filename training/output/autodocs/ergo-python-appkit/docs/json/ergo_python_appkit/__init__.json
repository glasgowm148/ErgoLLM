  "summary": "The code provided is a Python module that provides a set of utility functions for working with Ergo blockchain. The module is designed to be used as a part of the larger Ergo Python Appkit project. \n\nThe module provides a set of functions that allow users to interact with the Ergo blockchain, including functions for creating and signing transactions, querying the blockchain for information, and managing wallets. \n\nOne of the key functions provided by the module is the `create_transaction` function, which allows users to create a new transaction on the Ergo blockchain. This function takes a set of inputs, outputs, and other parameters, and returns a signed transaction that can be broadcast to the network. \n\nFor example, the following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `create_transaction` function to create a new transaction that sends Ergs from one address to another:\n\n```python\nfrom ergo_appkit import create_transaction\n\n# Define the inputs and outputs for the transaction\ninputs = [{'boxId': 'input_box_id', 'spendingProof': 'input_spending_proof'}]\noutputs = [{'value': 1000000, 'address': 'recipient_address'}]\n\n# Create the transaction\ntx = create_transaction(inputs, outputs)\n\n# Broadcast the transaction to the network\nbroadcast_tx(tx)\n```\n\nIn addition to the `create_transaction` function, the module also provides a number of other utility functions for working with the Ergo blockchain. These include functions for querying the blockchain for information about boxes, transactions, and addresses, as well as functions for managing wallets and signing transactions. \n\nOverall, the Ergo Python Appkit project provides a powerful set of tools for working with the Ergo blockchain in Python, and the `ergo_appkit` module is an essential part of this toolkit.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `get_balance` function?\n   - The `get_balance` function retrieves the balance of a specified address on the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `json.loads` method being used in the `send_transaction` function?\n   - The `json.loads` method is used to convert the transaction data from a JSON string to a Python dictionary, which can be processed by the function.\n\n3. What is the expected input format for the `send_transaction` function?\n   - The `send_transaction` function expects a JSON string containing the transaction data, as well as a private key and the network to broadcast the transaction to."
