      "summary": "This code is responsible for styling the user interface of the Ergo project. It imports various SCSS files, such as `_normalize.scss`, `_fonts.scss`, `variables`, `button`, and `infoModal`, which contain styles for different components and utilities used throughout the project. The code also includes a set of styles for the `html`, `body`, `ul`, `a`, and other elements to ensure consistent appearance across different browsers.\n\nThe `Backdrop.module.scss` file contains styles for a backdrop component, which is used to create a fixed, full-screen overlay with a content area and a semi-transparent background layer. This can be useful for displaying modal dialogs or other content that should appear above the rest of the page.\n\nThe `_fonts.scss` file defines the `@font-face` rules for the 'Roboto' and 'Material Icons' font families, which are used throughout the project. The `button` component styles define various button sizes and states, such as primary, secondary, and close buttons. The `infoModal` component styles define the appearance of an info modal dialog, including the layout, content, and buttons.\n\nThe `utils.scss` file contains a utility function `rem` that converts pixel values to rem units, which are relative to the base font size. This helps maintain consistent sizing and spacing throughout the project.\n\nOverall, this code ensures a consistent and polished appearance for the Ergo project's user interface, making it easier to build and maintain the project's components.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n\n   This code is a combination of CSS styles for a project called \"ergo\". It includes styles for various components, such as buttons and modals, as well as general styles for elements like headings, lists, and links. It also imports some external stylesheets, like normalize.css and custom font styles.\n\n2. **What are the imported stylesheets used for?**\n\n   The imported stylesheets serve different purposes:\n   - `_normalize.scss` is used to reset and normalize default browser styles for a consistent appearance across different browsers.\n   - `_fonts.scss` contains font-face declarations for custom fonts used in the project.\n   - `variables` is likely a file containing Sass variables for colors, font sizes, and other reusable values.\n   - `components/button.scss` and `components/infoModal.scss` contain styles specific to button and modal components in the project.\n   - `utils.scss` probably contains utility classes and functions for the project.\n\n3. **How are the styles organized in this code?**\n\n   The styles are organized into different sections, such as general styles for elements (e.g., headings, lists, links), component-specific styles (e.g., buttons, modals), and imported stylesheets. The code also includes media queries for responsive design, adjusting styles based on the screen size."

      "summary": "This file contains CSS code for the ergo project's user interface. The code defines the layout, styling, and behavior of various UI components such as containers, cards, tables, buttons, and modals. \n\nThe code uses CSS selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. For example, the `.main-container` class sets the position and margin of a container element, while the `.info-card` class defines the appearance of an information card. The code also uses CSS variables to define and reuse color and size values throughout the project.\n\nThe file includes several media queries that adjust the layout and styling of UI components based on the screen size. For example, the `.info-modal-backdrop` and `.info-modal` classes define the appearance of a modal dialog, and their styles change when the screen width is less than 767 pixels.\n\nThe code also includes some animations and transitions to enhance the user experience. For example, the `.ergo-loader` class defines the appearance of a loading spinner, and the `.info-modal` class uses a transition to fade in and slide up the modal when it is opened.\n\nOverall, this code plays a crucial role in defining the look and feel of the ergo project's user interface. It allows developers to create consistent and visually appealing UI components that are responsive to different screen sizes and devices. Here is an example of how the code can be used to create a button:\n\n```html\n<button class=\"button m\">\n  Click me\n  <svg class=\"button__arrow\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n    <path d=\"M16.59 8.59L12 13.17l-4.59-4.58L6 10l6 6 6-6z\"></path>\n  </svg>\n</button>\n``` \n\nThis code creates a button with medium size and an arrow icon on the right side. The button has a white background, a gray border, and a shadow effect. When the button is hovered or clicked, it changes its background color and box shadow to provide feedback to the user.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ergo-loader` class?\n- The `ergo-loader` class is used to display a loading spinner in the center of the screen, with a width and height of 80px.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Backdrop_backdrop__PmdBI` class?\n- The `Backdrop_backdrop__PmdBI` class is used to create a fixed position backdrop that covers the entire screen and allows for scrolling. It has a z-index of 1000.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `wallet-table__icon-redo` class?\n- The `wallet-table__icon-redo` class is used to display a circular arrow icon that represents a refresh or reload action. It has a width and height of 16px and a fill color of `var(--primary)`."
