      "summary": "This file contains a set of error messages that are used in the ergo project. These error messages are related to the JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) API, which is used to convert XML data to and from Java objects. \n\nThe error messages are defined as static variables with string values. They are used to provide more informative error messages when an exception is thrown during the execution of JAXB-related code. For example, if the unmarshaller object is null, the error message \"Unmarshaller can not be null\" will be displayed.\n\nThese error messages are used throughout the ergo project to provide more informative error messages to developers and users. They help to identify the cause of the error and provide guidance on how to fix it. \n\nHere is an example of how these error messages might be used in the ergo project:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(MyClass.class);\n    Unmarshaller unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();\n    MyClass myObject = (MyClass) unmarshaller.unmarshal(xmlFile);\n} catch (JAXBException e) {\n    throw new MyCustomException(JAXBResult.NullUnmarshaller, e);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if the unmarshaller object is null, the error message \"Unmarshaller can not be null\" will be passed to the MyCustomException constructor along with the original exception. This will provide more information about the cause of the exception and help developers to fix the issue.",

They are used throughout the ergo project to provide more informative error messages to developers and users, helping them identify the cause of the error and providing guidance on how to fix it.\n\nFor example, consider the following code snippet:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(MyClass.class);\n    Unmarshaller unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();\n    MyClass myObject = (MyClass) unmarshaller.unmarshal(xmlFile);\n} catch (JAXBException e) {\n    throw new MyCustomException(JAXBResult.NullUnmarshaller, e);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if the unmarshaller object is null, the error message \"Unmarshaller can not be null\" will be passed to the `MyCustomException` constructor along with the original exception. This will provide more information about the cause of the exception and help developers to fix the issue.\n\nBy using the error messages from the `Messages.properties` file, the ergo project can provide more meaningful and informative error messages when handling exceptions related to JAXB operations. This can help developers quickly identify and resolve issues, improving the overall quality and stability of the project.\n\nIn summary, the `Messages.properties` file in the ergo project is a resource file containing error messages related to JAXB operations. These error messages are used throughout the project to provide more informative error messages when handling exceptions, helping developers identify and fix issues more efficiently.",
