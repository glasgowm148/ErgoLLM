      "summary": "This file contains a set of error messages and constants used in the ergo project. The messages are related to XML marshalling and unmarshalling, as well as validation events. \n\nThe `AbstractUnmarshallerImpl.ISNotNull` constant is used to check if an input stream is null or not. This is used in the unmarshalling process to ensure that the input stream is not null before proceeding with the unmarshalling.\n\nThe `AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeBoolean` and `AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeString` constants are used to check if a given value is a boolean or a string, respectively. These are used in the marshalling process to ensure that the values being marshalled are of the correct type.\n\nThe `DefaultValidationEventHandler` messages are used to handle validation events during the unmarshalling process. The `SeverityMessage` message is used to display the severity of the validation event, along with its location. The `LocationUnavailable` message is used when the location of the validation event is not available. The `UnrecognizedSeverity` message is used when an unrecognized severity field is encountered. The `Warning`, `Error`, and `FatalError` messages are used to display the severity of the validation event, along with a message indicating the type of error encountered.\n\nThe `ValidationEventImpl.IllegalSeverity` message is used when an illegal severity is encountered during the validation process.\n\nThe `Shared.MustNotBeNull` constant is used to check if a given parameter is null or not. This is used throughout the project to ensure that null values are not passed to methods that require non-null values.\n\nOverall, this file provides a set of error messages and constants that are used throughout the ergo project to ensure that XML marshalling and unmarshalling, as well as validation events, are handled correctly. These messages and constants are used to provide informative error messages to users when errors occur during these processes.",

  "summary": "The `Messages.properties` file in the ergo project serves as a centralized location for storing error messages and constants related to XML marshalling, unmarshalling, and validation events. This approach ensures consistency in error handling and provides informative error messages to users when issues arise during these processes.\n\nFor instance, the `AbstractUnmarshallerImpl.ISNotNull` constant is used to verify if an input stream is null before proceeding with the unmarshalling process. This helps prevent potential issues caused by null input streams. An example usage of this constant might be:\n\n```java\nif (inputStream == null) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(Messages.properties.getString(\"AbstractUnmarshallerImpl.ISNotNull\"));\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, the `AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeBoolean` and `AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeString` constants are used to ensure that values being marshalled are of the correct type. This helps maintain data integrity during the marshalling process. An example usage of these constants might be:\n\n```java\nif (value instanceof Boolean) {\n    // Proceed with marshalling\n} else {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(Messages.properties.getString(\"AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeBoolean\"));\n}\n\nif (value instanceof String) {\n    // Proceed with marshalling\n} else {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(Messages.properties.getString(\"AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeString\"));\n}\n```\n\nThe `DefaultValidationEventHandler` messages are used to handle validation events during the unmarshalling process. These messages provide detailed information about the severity and location of validation events, allowing developers to quickly identify and resolve issues. An example usage of these messages might be:\n\n```java\nswitch (validationEvent.getSeverity()) {\n    case ValidationEvent.WARNING:\n        System.out.println(Messages.properties.getString(\"Warning\") + \": \" + validationEvent.getMessage());\n        break;\n    case ValidationEvent.ERROR:\n        System.out.println(Messages.properties.getString(\"Error\") + \": \" + validationEvent.getMessage());\n        break;\n    case ValidationEvent.FATAL_ERROR:\n        System.out.println(Messages.properties.getString(\"FatalError\") + \": \" + validationEvent.getMessage());\n        break;\n    default:\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(Messages.properties.getString(\"UnrecognizedSeverity\"));\n}\n```\n\nLastly, the `Shared.MustNotBeNull` constant is used throughout the project to ensure that null values are not passed to methods that require non-null values. This helps maintain code robustness and prevents potential issues caused by null values. An example usage of this constant might be:\n\n```java\nif (parameter == null) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(Messages.properties.getString(\"Shared.MustNotBeNull\"));\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the `Messages.properties` file in the ergo project provides a set of error messages and constants that are used to ensure proper handling of XML marshalling, unmarshalling, and validation events. These messages and constants help maintain code consistency, data integrity, and provide informative error messages to users when issues arise during these processes.",
