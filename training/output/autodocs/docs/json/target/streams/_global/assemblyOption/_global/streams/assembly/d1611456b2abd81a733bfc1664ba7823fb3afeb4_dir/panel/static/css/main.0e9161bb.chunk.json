  "summary": "This code defines the styling for various components in the ergo project's user interface. It includes styles for the main container, sidebar, navbar, toast notifications, info cards, loader animations, dashboards, backdrops, wallet tables, and buttons.\n\nThe main container is positioned absolutely and takes up the full height and width of the viewport, except for a 74px margin at the top. The sidebar is also positioned absolutely and takes up the full height of the viewport minus the 74px margin at the top, with a width of 256px and a right border of 1px. The navbar has a black background and white text, and is displayed as a flex container with centered items.\n\nToast notifications are styled with a dark gray background, white text, and a progress bar that changes color depending on the type of notification (success or error). Info cards have a white background, black text, and a maximum height of 120px. They are displayed as flex containers with a column direction and a border radius of 0. The loader animation is a spinning circle that is centered on the page. Dashboards are bordered containers with a grid layout that has four columns and a minimum width of 190px. Backdrops are fixed position containers that cover the entire viewport and have a semi-transparent black background. Wallet tables have a white background and a border, with a header that has a gray background and a title and label. Buttons have a white background, a box shadow, and a border radius of 8px.\n\nThese styles are used throughout the ergo project to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface. For example, the sidebar and navbar are used on every page to provide navigation and context for the user. The toast notifications are used to provide feedback to the user when an action has been completed or an error has occurred. The info cards are used to display important information in a concise and visually appealing way. The loader animation is used to indicate that a process is in progress. The dashboard is used to display data in a grid layout. The backdrop is used to create a modal overlay for displaying additional information or actions. The wallet table is used to display a list of wallets and their associated information. The buttons are used for various actions throughout the project.",
