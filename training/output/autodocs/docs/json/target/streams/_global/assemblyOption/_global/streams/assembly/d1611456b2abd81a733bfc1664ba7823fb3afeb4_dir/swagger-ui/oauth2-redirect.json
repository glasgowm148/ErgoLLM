  "summary": "The code is an HTML file that contains a script that is executed when the body of the HTML file is loaded. The script is responsible for handling the OAuth2 authentication flow for the Swagger UI. \n\nWhen the script is executed, it first retrieves the OAuth2 object from the parent window. It then checks the URL hash to see if it contains a code, token, or error. If it does, it extracts the query parameters from the hash. Otherwise, it extracts the query parameters from the URL search string. \n\nThe query parameters are then parsed into a JSON object. If the state parameter in the JSON object matches the state that was sent in the OAuth2 request, the script proceeds with the authentication flow. Otherwise, it displays a warning message indicating that the authorization may be unsafe. \n\nIf the authentication flow is an access code or authorization code flow and no code has been received yet, the script checks if a code has been returned in the query parameters. If a code is found, it sets the code in the OAuth2 object and calls the callback function with the authentication object and the redirect URL. If no code is found, it displays an error message indicating that no access code was received from the server. \n\nIf the authentication flow is not an access code or authorization code flow, or if a code has already been received, the script calls the callback function with the authentication object, the token, and a flag indicating whether the state is valid. \n\nFinally, the script closes the window. \n\nThis code is used to handle the OAuth2 authentication flow for the Swagger UI. It is likely part of a larger project that uses the Swagger UI to interact with an API that requires authentication. The code can be used as-is or modified to fit the specific needs of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<body onload=\"run()\">\n</body>\n</html>\n<script>\n    // OAuth2 object from parent window\n    var oauth2 = window.opener.swaggerUIRedirectOauth2;\n\n    function run () {\n        // Authentication flow\n        // ...\n\n        // Callback function\n        function callback(data) {\n            console.log(data);\n        }\n\n        // Error callback function\n        function errCb(data) {\n            console.error(data);\n        }\n\n        // Set OAuth2 callback and error callback functions\n        oauth2.callback = callback;\n        oauth2.errCb = errCb;\n\n        // Close window\n        window.close();\n    }\n</script>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code is an HTML and JavaScript file that handles OAuth2 authentication for the Swagger UI.\n\n2. What is the role of the `run()` function?\n   \n   The `run()` function is called when the HTML body is loaded and handles the OAuth2 authentication flow by checking the URL for a code, token, or error and calling the appropriate callback function.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `oauth2` object?\n   \n   The `oauth2` object is used to store information about the OAuth2 authentication flow, including the state, redirect URL, and authentication schema. It is used throughout the `run()` function to handle the authentication flow."
