The script is intended for SQLite3 databases and has been tested on SQLite 3.7.4 on Android ICS (4.0.3).\n\nThe script begins by dropping any existing tables named logging_event_property, logging_event_exception, and logging_event. Then, it creates a new table named logging_event with columns for the timestamp of the event, the formatted message, the logger name, the logging level, the thread name, a reference flag, and up to four arguments. It also includes columns for the filename, class, method, and line number of the caller, as well as an event ID that serves as the primary key and is automatically incremented for each new event.\n\nNext, the script creates a table named logging_event_property with columns for the event ID, a mapped key, and a mapped value.
