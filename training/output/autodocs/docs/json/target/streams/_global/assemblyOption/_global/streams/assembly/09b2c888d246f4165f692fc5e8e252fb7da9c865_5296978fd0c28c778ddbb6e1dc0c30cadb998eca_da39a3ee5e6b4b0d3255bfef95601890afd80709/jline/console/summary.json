The constants are related to displaying information to the user. \n\nThe first constant, `DISPLAY_CANDIDATES`, is a string that asks the user if they want to display all possibilities. It includes a placeholder for the number of possibilities, which is likely filled in dynamically based on the context of the program. \n\nThe next two constants, `DISPLAY_CANDIDATES_YES` and `DISPLAY_CANDIDATES_NO`, are strings that represent the user's response to the `DISPLAY_CANDIDATES` prompt. These are likely used to determine whether or not to display the possibilities. \n\nThe final constant, `DISPLAY_MORE`, is a string that is likely used to prompt the user to display more information. It may be used in conjunction with the `DISPLAY_CANDIDATES` prompt to allow the user to see more information about the possibilities before making a decision. \n\nOverall, these constants are likely used throughout the larger project to standardize the way information is displayed to the user. For example, if there are multiple parts of the program that need to ask the user if they want to see all possibilities, they can all use the `DISPLAY_CANDIDATES` constant to ensure consistency in the wording of the prompt. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nif user_input == DISPLAY_CANDIDATES_YES:\n    display_all_possibilities()\nelse:\n    display_top_possibilities()\n```",

What is the significance of the variables DISPLAY_CANDIDATES, DISPLAY_CANDIDATES_YES, DISPLAY_CANDIDATES_NO, and DISPLAY_MORE?\n   - These variables are likely used for displaying options or prompts to the user in some part of the ergo project.\n\n3. Is there any other documentation or information available about the ergo project?\n   - It is unclear from this code snippet whether there is additional documentation or information available about the ergo project."
