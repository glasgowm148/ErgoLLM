          "summary": "This code is responsible for styling the user interface of the Ergo project. It imports various SCSS files, such as `_normalize.scss`, `_fonts.scss`, `variables`, `button`, and `infoModal`, which contain styles for different components and utilities used throughout the project.\n\nThe main focus of this code is to apply consistent styles across different elements, such as fonts, buttons, and modals. It also includes some utility functions, like the `rem` function, which is used to convert pixel values to rem units for better responsiveness.\n\nFor example, the `button` component has different sizes (large, medium, and small) and variations (primary, secondary, and close). The styles for these buttons are defined in the `components/button.scss` file, which is imported and used in the main code.\n\nAnother important component is the `infoModal`, which is a modal dialog with a backdrop. The styles for this component are defined in the `components/infoModal.scss` file. It includes styles for the modal's content, buttons, and close button, as well as responsive styles for different screen sizes.\n\nThe code also includes some global styles, such as setting the `box-sizing` property to `border-box` for all elements, and defining the default font family as 'Roboto'. Additionally, it includes styles for normalizing the appearance of various HTML elements across different browsers, such as headings, lists, links, and form elements.\n\nOverall, this code ensures a consistent and responsive user interface for the Ergo project by applying styles to various components and elements.",
          "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n\n   This code is a combination of CSS styles for a project called \"ergo\". It includes styles for various components, such as buttons and modals, as well as general styles for elements like headings, links, and lists. It also imports some external stylesheets, like normalize.css and custom font styles.\n\n2. **What are the imported stylesheets used for?**\n\n   The imported stylesheets serve different purposes: `_normalize.scss` is used to reset and normalize the default styles of various HTML elements across different browsers; `_fonts.scss` is used to define custom font faces for the project; `variables` is likely used to define global variables for the project, such as colors and breakpoints; and the other imports are for specific components like buttons and modals.\n\n3. **How are the styles organized in this code?**\n\n   The styles are organized into different sections, starting with imports for external stylesheets, followed by general styles for elements like headings, links, and lists. Then, there are specific styles for components like buttons and modals. The code also includes some utility functions and media queries for responsive design."

It includes styles for the main container, sidebar, navbar, toast notifications, info cards, loader animations, dashboards, backdrops, wallet tables, and buttons.\n\nThe main container is positioned absolutely and takes up the full height and width of the viewport, except for a 74px margin at the top. The sidebar is also positioned absolutely and takes up the full height of the viewport minus the 74px margin at the top, with a width of 256px and a right border of 1px. The navbar has a black background and white text, and is displayed as a flex container with centered items.\n\nToast notifications are styled with a dark gray background, white text, and a progress bar that changes color depending on the type of notification (success or error). Info cards have a white background, black text, and a maximum height of 120px. They are displayed as flex containers with a column direction and a border radius of 0. The loader animation is a spinning circle that is centered on the page. Dashboards are bordered containers with a grid layout that has four columns and a minimum width of 190px. Backdrops are fixed position containers that cover the entire viewport and have a semi-transparent black background. Wallet tables have a white background and a border, with a header that has a gray background and a title and label. Buttons have a white background, a box shadow, and a border radius of 8px.\n\nThese styles are used throughout the ergo project to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface. For example, the sidebar and navbar are used on every page to provide navigation and context for the user. The toast notifications are used to provide feedback to the user when an action has been completed or an error has occurred. The info cards are used to display important information in a concise and visually appealing way. The loader animation is used to indicate that a process is in progress.
