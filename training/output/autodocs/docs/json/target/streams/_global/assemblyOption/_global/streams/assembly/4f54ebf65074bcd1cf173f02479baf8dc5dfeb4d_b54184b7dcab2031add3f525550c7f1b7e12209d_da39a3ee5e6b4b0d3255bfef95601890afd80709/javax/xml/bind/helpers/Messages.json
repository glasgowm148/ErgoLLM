  "summary": "This file contains a set of error messages and constants used in the ergo project. The messages are related to XML marshalling and unmarshalling, as well as validation events. \n\nThe `AbstractUnmarshallerImpl.ISNotNull` constant is used to check if an input stream is null or not. This is used in the unmarshalling process to ensure that the input stream is not null before proceeding with the unmarshalling.\n\nThe `AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeBoolean` and `AbstractMarshallerImpl.MustBeString` constants are used to check if a given value is a boolean or a string, respectively. These are used in the marshalling process to ensure that the values being marshalled are of the correct type.\n\nThe `DefaultValidationEventHandler` messages are used to handle validation events during the unmarshalling process. The `SeverityMessage` message is used to display the severity of the validation event, along with its location. The `LocationUnavailable` message is used when the location of the validation event is not available. The `UnrecognizedSeverity` message is used when an unrecognized severity field is encountered. The `Warning`, `Error`, and `FatalError` messages are used to display the severity of the validation event, along with a message indicating the type of error encountered.\n\nThe `ValidationEventImpl.IllegalSeverity` message is used when an illegal severity is encountered during the validation process.\n\nThe `Shared.MustNotBeNull` constant is used to check if a given parameter is null or not. This is used throughout the project to ensure that null values are not passed to methods that require non-null values.\n\nOverall, this file provides a set of error messages and constants that are used throughout the ergo project to ensure that XML marshalling and unmarshalling, as well as validation events, are handled correctly. These messages and constants are used to provide informative error messages to users when errors occur during these processes.",

What are the different types of licenses that can be used for this project?\n- The project can be licensed under either the GNU General Public License Version 2 or the Common Development and Distribution License.\n\n3. What are some of the error messages that can be generated by the DefaultValidationEventHandler?\n- The DefaultValidationEventHandler can generate error messages for warnings, errors, and fatal errors, as well as messages for unrecognized severity fields and unavailable locations."
