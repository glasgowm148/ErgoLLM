These parameters are included in the extension section of the first block of a voting epoch. \n\nThe trait defines several methods that return the values of different parameters. These parameters include the cost of storing 1 byte in UTXO for four years, the cost of a transaction output, the maximum block size, the cost of a token contained in a transaction, the cost of a transaction input, the cost of a transaction data input, the cost of a transaction output, and the computation units limit per block. \n\nIn addition, the trait also defines two optional parameters: the height when voting for a soft-fork had been started and the votes for soft-fork collected in previous epochs. Finally, the trait defines a method that returns the protocol version. \n\nThis code is part of the larger Ergo project and is used to define the blockchain parameters that can be readjusted via miners voting and voting-related data. These parameters are important for the functioning of the blockchain and can have a significant impact on the performance and security of the system. \n\nFor example, the `maxBlockSize` parameter determines the maximum size of a block in bytes, which can affect the speed and efficiency of the blockchain. The `storageFeeFactor` parameter determines the cost of storing data in the UTXO, which can affect the cost of transactions and the overall cost of using the blockchain. \n\nDevelopers working on the Ergo project can use this code to access and modify the blockchain parameters as needed. For example, they can use the `softForkStartingHeight` parameter to determine when a soft-fork should be started or the `maxBlockCost` parameter to limit the computation units per block. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the Ergo project and helps to ensure that the blockchain parameters can be adjusted as needed to maintain the performance and security of the system.",

This information is used to validate transactions against the current state of the blockchain. \n\nThe second method `previousStateDigest` returns the UTXO set digest from the last header in `sigmaLastHeaders`. This information is also used in transaction validation to ensure that the UTXO set is consistent with the current state of the blockchain. \n\nThe third method `sigmaPreHeader` returns the pre-header of the current block.
