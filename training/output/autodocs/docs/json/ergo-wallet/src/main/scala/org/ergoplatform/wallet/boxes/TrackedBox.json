  "summary": "The `TrackedBox` class is a representation of an Ergo box that is tracked by a wallet. It contains information about the box's creation and spending status, as well as its underlying Ergo box and any scans it refers to. \n\nThe class has several methods that allow for the derivation of the box's status. The `spendingStatus` method returns whether the box is spent or not, while the `creationChainStatus` and `spendingChainStatus` methods return whether the box creation and spending are confirmed or not. The `chainStatus` method returns the overall chain status of the box, which is `OffChain` if the box creation or spending is not confirmed, and `OnChain` otherwise.\n\nThe `TrackedBox` class also has a `tokens` field that contains information about any additional tokens associated with the box. The `TrackedBoxSerializer` object provides serialization and deserialization methods for the `TrackedBox` class.\n\nThe `TrackedBox` class is used in the larger Ergo project to represent boxes that are tracked by a wallet. It allows for the derivation of the box's status and provides information about any additional tokens associated with the box. The `TrackedBox` class is used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Ergo project to manage and track boxes in a wallet. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval trackedBox = TrackedBox(creationTxId, creationOutIndex, inclusionHeightOpt, spendingTxIdOpt, spendingHeightOpt, box, scans)\nprintln(trackedBox.spendingStatus) // Unspent\nprintln(trackedBox.creationChainStatus) // OnChain\nprintln(trackedBox.spendingChainStatus) // OffChain\nprintln(trackedBox.chainStatus) // OffChain\nprintln(trackedBox.tokens) // Map()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TrackedBox` class?\n- The `TrackedBox` class represents an Ergo box that is tracked by a wallet and contains information about its state, such as whether it has been spent or confirmed on the blockchain.\n\n2. What is the `TrackedBoxSerializer` used for?\n- The `TrackedBoxSerializer` is used to serialize and deserialize instances of the `TrackedBox` class, allowing them to be stored and retrieved from storage.\n\n3. What is the `tokens` property of a `TrackedBox`?\n- The `tokens` property of a `TrackedBox` is a map of additional tokens that are stored in the box, represented as a `TokensMap` object."
