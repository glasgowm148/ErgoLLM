  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `SecretStorage` which is used to store and manage secrets for a wallet. The trait provides methods to lock and unlock the secrets, check if the secrets are locked, and destroy all loaded secrets. The secrets are derived from a single seed which is stored in an encrypted file on the file system. The `secretFile` property provides the path to the secret file containing the encrypted seed and all the required cipher parameters to decrypt the seed providing the correct password.\n\nThe `unlock` method is used to make secrets available through the `secret` method call. It takes a `SecretString` password string as input which is erased after use. The `checkSeed` method is used to check if the seed can be decrypted, provided a mnemonic with an optional mnemonic password. It takes a `SecretString` mnemonic string and an optional `SecretString` mnemonic password as input which are both erased after use.\n\nThe `SecretStorage` trait is designed to be used as a part of a larger project called `ergo`. It can be implemented by other classes or traits to provide secret storage functionality to the project. For example, a `Wallet` class can implement the `SecretStorage` trait to store and manage secrets for the wallet. The `SecretStorage` trait can also be extended to add more functionality to it, such as methods to backup and restore secrets, or to store secrets in a remote location. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport org.ergoplatform.wallet.secrets._\n\n// create a wallet class that implements the SecretStorage trait\nclass Wallet extends SecretStorage {\n  val secretFile: File = new File(\"path/to/secret/file\")\n\n  def isLocked: Boolean = ???\n\n  def secret: Option[ExtendedSecretKey] = ???\n\n  def unlock(pass: SecretString): Try[Unit] = ???\n\n  def lock(): Unit = ???\n\n  def checkSeed(mnemonic: SecretString, mnemonicPassOpt: Option[SecretString]): Boolean = ???\n}\n\n// use the wallet class to store and manage secrets\nval wallet = new Wallet()\nwallet.unlock(SecretString(\"password\"))\nval secret = wallet.secret\nwallet.lock()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a trait called `SecretStorage` which provides an interface for storing and accessing encrypted secrets for a wallet.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `SecretString` class?\n- The `SecretString` class is used for sensitive information such as passwords and mnemonics, and is designed to be erased from memory after use to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. How are the secrets unlocked and locked?\n- The `unlock` method is used to unlock the secrets with a given password, while the `lock` method is used to destroy all loaded secrets. The `isLocked` method can be used to check if the secrets are currently locked."
