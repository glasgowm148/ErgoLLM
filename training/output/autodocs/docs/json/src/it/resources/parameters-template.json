  "summary": "The code provided defines the paths and methods for the ergo project's API. The API provides endpoints for interacting with the blockchain, including retrieving block headers and transactions, as well as utility functions for hashing and generating random seeds.\n\nThe `/blocks` endpoint provides access to block headers and transactions. The `POST` method allows for the creation of new blocks. The example provided in the code includes a block header and two transactions. Each transaction includes inputs, data inputs, and outputs. The inputs reference previous boxes (identified by their boxId) and include spending proofs. The outputs include the boxId of the new box, the value of the box, the ergoTree script, and any assets or additional registers associated with the box.\n\nThe `/transactions` endpoint allows for the creation of new transactions. The example provided includes a transaction with one input and one output. The input references a previous box and includes a spending proof. The output includes the boxId of the new box, the value of the box, the ergoTree script, and any assets or additional registers associated with the box.\n\nThe `/utils` endpoint provides utility functions. The `/utils/hash/blake2b` endpoint allows for the hashing of input strings using the blake2b algorithm. The `/utils/seed/{length}` endpoint generates a random seed of the specified length.\n\nOverall, this code defines the API endpoints for interacting with the ergo blockchain. Developers can use these endpoints to build applications that interact with the blockchain, including creating and retrieving blocks and transactions, as well as performing utility functions like hashing and generating random seeds.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines the paths and parameters for an API related to blocks and transactions in a project called ergo.\n\n2. What is the structure of a block transaction in this code?\n- A block transaction contains an ID, inputs (with box ID and spending proof), data inputs, outputs (with box ID, value, ergo tree, assets, additional registers, and creation height), and size.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the /utils endpoints in this code?\n- The /utils endpoints provide functionality for hashing and generating random seeds of a specified length."
