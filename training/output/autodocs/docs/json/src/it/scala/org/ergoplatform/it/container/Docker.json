  "summary": "The `Docker` class in this code is responsible for managing Docker containers for the Ergo project. It provides methods to start, stop, and manage nodes in different network types (DevNet, TestNet, and MainNet). The class also handles the creation and management of Docker networks and provides methods to connect and disconnect nodes from the network.\n\nThe `Docker` class takes a `suiteConfig`, `tag`, and `localDataVolumeOpt` as input parameters. It initializes an HTTP client, a Docker client, and sets up a network with a unique name and IP address range. The class also provides methods to start nodes with specific configurations and network types, such as `startDevNetNodes`, `startTestNetNode`, and `startMainNetNodeYesImSure`.\n\nThe `Docker` class also provides methods to manage the lifecycle of nodes, such as `stopNode`, `forceStopNode`, and `close`. These methods are used to stop and remove containers, as well as clean up resources like networks and images.\n\nAdditionally, the class provides utility methods for working with Docker networks, such as `createNetwork`, `connectToNetwork`, `disconnectFromNetwork`, and `waitForNetwork`. These methods are used to create, connect, and manage Docker networks for the Ergo project.\n\nExample usage of the `Docker` class:\n\n```scala\nval docker = new Docker(suiteConfig, \"ergo_integration_test\")\nval nodeConfig = ConfigFactory.parseString(\"...\") // node-specific configuration\nval extraConfig: Docker.ExtraConfig = (docker, config) => Some(ConfigFactory.parseString(\"...\"))\n\n// Start a DevNet node\nval nodeTry = docker.startDevNetNode(nodeConfig, extraConfig)\nnodeTry.foreach { node =>\n  // Interact with the node\n  // ...\n\n  // Stop the node\n  docker.stopNode(node)\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the `Docker` class provides a high-level interface for managing Docker containers and networks for the Ergo project, allowing for easy setup and teardown of nodes in different network types.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `Docker` class and how does it work?**\n\n   The `Docker` class is responsible for managing Docker containers for the Ergo project during integration testing. It provides methods to start, stop, and manage nodes and networks, as well as handling configuration and resource cleanup.\n\n2. **How does the `startNode` method work and what parameters does it accept?**\n\n   The `startNode` method starts a new Ergo node in a Docker container with the given network type, node-specific configuration, extra configuration, and an optional special volume. It builds the Ergo settings, container configuration, and connects the container to the network before starting it.\n\n3. **How does the `cleanupDanglingResources` method work?**\n\n   The `cleanupDanglingResources` method cleans up Docker resources such as containers, networks, and images that are no longer needed. It removes containers with names starting with the `networkNamePrefix`, custom networks with names starting with the `networkNamePrefix`, and dangling images with the `dockerImageLabel`."
