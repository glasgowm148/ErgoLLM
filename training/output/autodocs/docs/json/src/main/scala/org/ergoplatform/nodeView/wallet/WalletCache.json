  "summary": "The `WalletCache` class is a data structure that stores information about a wallet's public key addresses, tracked public keys, tracked bytes, and scripts filter. It is used to cache fields that are potentially costly to compute if there are many keys in the wallet. \n\nThe `WalletCache` class has a constructor that takes in a sequence of `ExtendedPublicKey` objects and an `ErgoSettings` object. It creates a bloom filter for scanning wallet-related scripts efficiently. The bloom filter is used to track mining rewards only if mining is enabled in the configuration. The bloom filter is updated with new public keys when they are added to the wallet. \n\nThe `WalletCache` class has a method `withNewPubkey` that takes in a new public key and returns a new `WalletCache` object with the updated fields. \n\nThe `WalletCache` object has several utility methods. The `miningScripts` method takes in a sequence of `ExtendedPublicKey` objects and an `ErgoSettings` object and returns a sequence of `Values.ErgoTree` objects. The `emptyFilter` method creates an empty bloom filter. The `createScriptsFilter` method takes in a sequence of tracked bytes, mining scripts bytes, and a `WalletProfile` object and returns a bloom filter for scanning wallet-related scripts efficiently. The `trackedBytes` method takes in a sequence of `ExtendedPublicKey` objects and returns a sequence of tracked bytes. The `publicKeyAddresses` method takes in a sequence of `ExtendedPublicKey` objects and an `ErgoAddressEncoder` object and returns a sequence of `P2PKAddress` objects. \n\nOverall, the `WalletCache` class and `WalletCache` object are used to cache fields that are potentially costly to compute if there are many keys in the wallet. The bloom filter is used to efficiently scan wallet-related scripts. The `WalletCache` class is used in the larger project to improve the performance of the wallet. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval pubKey = ExtendedPublicKey(...)\nval settings = ErgoSettings(...)\nval walletCache = WalletCache(Seq(pubKey), settings)\nval newPubKey = ExtendedPublicKey(...)\nval updatedWalletCache = walletCache.withNewPubkey(newPubKey).get\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WalletCache` class?\n- The `WalletCache` class represents a cache of wallet-related data that is potentially costly to compute if there are many keys in the wallet.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `miningScripts` method in the `WalletCache` object?\n- The `miningScripts` method constructs a sequence of ErgoTree scripts that represent mining reward output scripts for a given sequence of extended public keys.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `createScriptsFilter` method in the `WalletCache` object?\n- The `createScriptsFilter` method constructs a Bloom filter that can be used to efficiently scan wallet-related scripts, given a sequence of tracked bytes and mining scripts bytes, and a wallet profile."
