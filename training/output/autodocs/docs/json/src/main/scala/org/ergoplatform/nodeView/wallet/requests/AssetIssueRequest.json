  "summary": "The code defines a request for issuing a new asset in the Ergo platform. The `AssetIssueRequest` class represents the request and contains the following parameters: `addressOpt`, `valueOpt`, `amount`, `name`, `description`, `decimals`, and `registers`. \n\nThe `addressOpt` parameter is an optional Ergo address where the asset will be issued. The `valueOpt` parameter is an optional amount of Ergo tokens that will be sent to the address. The `amount` parameter is the total amount of the new asset to be issued. The `name` parameter is a verbose name for the asset. The `description` parameter is a description of the asset. The `decimals` parameter is the number of decimal places for the asset. The `registers` parameter is an optional map of additional registers that can be used for asset-specific information.\n\nThe `AssetIssueRequest` class also has a companion object that provides a convenience method for creating an instance of the class with a non-empty `addressOpt` parameter.\n\nThe `AssetIssueRequestEncoder` and `AssetIssueRequestDecoder` classes are used to encode and decode the `AssetIssueRequest` class to and from JSON format. These classes use the `io.circe` library for JSON encoding and decoding. The `AssetIssueRequestEncoder` class encodes an instance of the `AssetIssueRequest` class to JSON format, while the `AssetIssueRequestDecoder` class decodes a JSON object to an instance of the `AssetIssueRequest` class.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to create a request for issuing a new asset in the Ergo platform. The request can be encoded and decoded to and from JSON format using the `AssetIssueRequestEncoder` and `AssetIssueRequestDecoder` classes. This code is likely used in the larger Ergo project to facilitate the creation and management of assets on the platform. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval request = AssetIssueRequest(\n  addressOpt = Some(address),\n  valueOpt = Some(1000000000L),\n  amount = 1000000L,\n  name = \"MyAsset\",\n  description = \"An asset created for testing purposes\",\n  decimals = 2,\n  registers = Some(Map(\n    NonMandatoryRegisterId.R7 -> LongConstant(12345L),\n    NonMandatoryRegisterId.R8 -> ByteArrayConstant(Array[Byte](1, 2, 3)),\n    NonMandatoryRegisterId.R9 -> TrueLeaf\n  ))\n)\n\nval encoder = new AssetIssueRequestEncoder(settings)\nval json = encoder(request).noSpaces\nprintln(json)\n// Output: {\"address\":\"9f3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d7f8c3d3c3d3f1d",
