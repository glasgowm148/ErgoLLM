  "summary": "The `ErgoTransaction` class represents an atomic state transition operation in the Ergo platform. It is responsible for destroying boxes from the state and creating new ones. Transactions are not encrypted, allowing anyone to browse and view every transaction ever collected into a block.\n\nThe `ErgoTransaction` class takes the following parameters:\n\n- `inputs`: The boxes that will be spent by this transaction.\n- `dataInputs`: The boxes that are not going to be spent by the transaction but will be reachable from input scripts. Their scripts will not be executed, so their script costs are not included in the transaction cost, and they do not contain spending proofs.\n- `outputCandidates`: The box candidates to be created by this transaction. They differ from ordinary ones in that they do not include transaction id and index.\n\nThe `validateStateless` method performs stateless transaction validation, checking if the transaction has inputs, outputs, and other basic properties. The `statelessValidity` method wraps the result of `validateStateless` in a `Try[Unit]`.\n\nThe `validateStateful` method checks whether the transaction is valid against input boxes to spend and non-spendable data inputs. It performs checks that are possible when input boxes are available. To make a full transaction validation, use `(tx.statelessValidity && tx.statefulValidity(...))`. The `statefulValidity` method wraps the result of `validateStateful` in a `Try[Int]`.\n\nThe `ErgoTransaction` class also provides serialization and deserialization functionality through the `ErgoTransactionSerializer` object.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval inputs: IndexedSeq[Input] = ...\nval dataInputs: IndexedSeq[DataInput] = ...\nval outputCandidates: IndexedSeq[ErgoBoxCandidate] = ...\n\nval ergoTransaction = ErgoTransaction(inputs, dataInputs, outputCandidates)\n\n// Stateless validation\nval statelessValidationResult = ergoTransaction.statelessValidity()\n\n// Stateful validation\nval boxesToSpend: IndexedSeq[ErgoBox] = ...\nval dataBoxes: IndexedSeq[ErgoBox] = ...\nval stateContext: ErgoStateContext = ...\nval accumulatedCost: Long = 0L\nimplicit val verifier: ErgoInterpreter = ...\nval statefulValidationResult = ergoTransaction.statefulValidity(boxesToSpend, dataBoxes, stateContext, accumulatedCost)\n```\n\nOverall, the `ErgoTransaction` class plays a crucial role in the Ergo platform by handling the creation and validation of transactions, which are the building blocks of the blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ErgoTransaction` class?\n   **Answer**: The `ErgoTransaction` class represents an atomic state transition operation in the Ergo platform. It is responsible for destroying boxes from the state and creating new ones. It also contains methods for stateless and stateful validation of transactions against input boxes to spend and non-spendable data inputs.\n\n2. **Question**: What are the main components of an `ErgoTransaction`?\n   **Answer**: An `ErgoTransaction` consists of inputs (boxes to be spent), data inputs (boxes to be read but not spent), output candidates (new boxes to be created), and an optional size parameter.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `validateStateful` method work?\n   **Answer**: The `validateStateful` method checks the validity of a transaction against input boxes to spend and non-spendable data inputs in a given state context. It performs various validation checks, such as ensuring that outputs are not dust, checking for overflow in input and output values, and verifying input spending correctness. The result is returned as a `ValidationState[Long]`, which contains the total computation cost or error details."
