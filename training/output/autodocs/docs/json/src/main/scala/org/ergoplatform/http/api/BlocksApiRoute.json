  "summary": "The `BlocksApiRoute` class is a part of the Ergo platform's HTTP API and provides endpoints for interacting with blocks in the blockchain. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to blocks, such as retrieving block headers, transactions, and proofs, as well as posting new blocks to the blockchain.\n\nThe class defines several methods for handling different types of requests, such as `getBlocksR` for retrieving block headers with pagination, `postBlocksR` for posting new blocks to the blockchain, and `getProofForTxR` for retrieving Merkle proofs for transactions in a block. These methods use the `ErgoHistoryReader` class to interact with the blockchain and retrieve the necessary data.\n\nThe `BlocksApiRoute` class also defines several helper methods for retrieving block data, such as `getHeaderIdsAtHeight` for retrieving block header IDs at a given height, `getLastHeaders` for retrieving the last `n` block headers, and `getFullBlockByHeaderId` for retrieving a full block given its header ID.\n\nOverall, the `BlocksApiRoute` class provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface for interacting with blocks in the Ergo blockchain. It can be used by other components of the Ergo platform, such as the wallet or mining software, to interact with the blockchain via HTTP requests. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval blocksApiRoute = BlocksApiRoute(viewHolderRef, readersHolder, ergoSettings)\nval route = blocksApiRoute.route\n```\n\nThis creates an instance of `BlocksApiRoute` with the given `viewHolderRef`, `readersHolder`, and `ergoSettings`, and returns the `route` that can be used to handle HTTP requests related to blocks.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BlocksApiRoute` class?\n- The `BlocksApiRoute` class is an API route for interacting with blocks in the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `getHistory` method?\n- The `getHistory` method retrieves an `ErgoHistoryReader` instance from the `readersHolder` actor, which is used to access the blockchain history.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getProofForTx` method?\n- The `getProofForTx` method retrieves a `MerkleProof` for a transaction with the given `txId` in the block with the given `headerId`."
