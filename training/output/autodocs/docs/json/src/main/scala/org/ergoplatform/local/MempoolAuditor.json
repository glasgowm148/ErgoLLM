  "summary": "The `MempoolAuditor` class is responsible for controlling the mempool cleanup workflow in the Ergo platform. It watches NodeView events and delegates the mempool cleanup task to the `CleanupWorker` when needed. \n\nThe class extends the `Actor` trait and overrides some of its methods such as `postRestart`, `postStop`, and `receive`. It also defines a `supervisorStrategy` that specifies how the actor should behave in case of exceptions. \n\nThe `MempoolAuditor` class has three main states: `awaiting`, `working`, and `initiateCleanup`. The `awaiting` state is the initial state, where the actor waits for a `RecheckMempool` message that contains the `UtxoStateReader` and `ErgoMemPoolReader` objects. Once it receives the message, it stores the objects in `stateReaderOpt` and `poolReaderOpt` variables and initiates the cleanup process by calling the `initiateCleanup` method. \n\nThe `initiateCleanup` method creates a new `CleanupWorker` actor and sends it a `RunCleanup` message with the `UtxoStateReader` and `ErgoMemPoolReader` objects. It then switches the actor's state to `working`. \n\nThe `working` state is where the actor waits for the `CleanupDone` message from the `CleanupWorker`. Once it receives the message, it rebroadcasts the transactions in the mempool by calling the `rebroadcastTransactions` method and switches the actor's state back to `awaiting`. \n\nThe `rebroadcastTransactions` method rebroadcasts the transactions in the mempool by creating a new `Message` object and sending it to the network controller. It first selects a random subset of transactions from the mempool and then checks if all the inputs of each transaction are in the UTXO set. If they are, it rebroadcasts the transaction; otherwise, it logs a warning message. \n\nOverall, the `MempoolAuditor` class plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the Ergo platform by ensuring that the mempool is cleaned up periodically and that all transactions in the mempool are valid.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall ergo project?\n- This code controls the mempool cleanup workflow and delegates the task to a CleanupWorker. It is part of the local package in the ergo project.\n\n2. What is the supervisor strategy used in this code and how does it handle exceptions?\n- The supervisor strategy used is OneForOneStrategy, which applies to the worker actor. It allows for a maximum of 5 retries within a 1-minute time range. It stops the worker actor in case of ActorKilledException or DeathPactException, and restarts it in case of other exceptions.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the rebroadcastTransactions() method and how does it work?\n- The rebroadcastTransactions() method rebroadcasts unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. It selects a random subset of transactions to rebroadcast, and checks if all the inputs of each transaction are in the UTXO set. If they are, the transaction is rebroadcasted, otherwise it is not."
