  "summary": "The code defines a Scala case class called `CollectedBoxes` that represents a response for requested boxes that contains `ErgoBoxes` and `ChangeBoxes`. The `ErgoBox` is a class that represents a box in the Ergo blockchain, while the `ChangeBox` is a custom class that represents a box with excessive tokens and ergs. \n\nThe `CollectedBoxes` class has two fields: `boxes` and `changeBoxes`, both of which are sequences of `ErgoBox` and `ChangeBox` objects, respectively. The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to group together the boxes that satisfy a user's request and the boxes with excessive tokens and ergs.\n\nThe code also defines an `encoder` for the `CollectedBoxes` class using the `circe` library. The `encoder` is used to convert an instance of the `CollectedBoxes` class to a JSON object. The resulting JSON object has two fields: `boxes` and `changeBoxes`, which are JSON arrays containing the `ErgoBox` and `ChangeBox` objects, respectively.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to provide a response to a user's request for boxes in the Ergo blockchain. The `CollectedBoxes` class provides a convenient way to group together the boxes that satisfy the user's request and the boxes with excessive tokens and ergs. The resulting JSON object can be easily transmitted over the network or stored in a database. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval ergoBoxes: Seq[ErgoBox] = Seq(ErgoBox(), ErgoBox())\nval changeBoxes: Seq[ChangeBox] = Seq(ChangeBox(), ChangeBox())\n\nval collectedBoxes = CollectedBoxes(ergoBoxes, changeBoxes)\n\nval json = collectedBoxes.asJson\nprintln(json)\n// Output: {\"boxes\":[{\"value\":0,\"ergoTree\":\"\", ... }],\"changeBoxes\":[{\"value\":0,\"ergoTree\":\"\", ... }]}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CollectedBoxes` class?\n- The `CollectedBoxes` class is a response for requested boxes that contains `ErgoBoxes` and `ChangeBoxes`.\n\n2. What is the role of the `JsonCodecs` trait?\n- The `JsonCodecs` trait provides implicit encoders and decoders for JSON serialization and deserialization.\n\n3. How is the `encoder` implemented for the `CollectedBoxes` class?\n- The `encoder` for the `CollectedBoxes` class is implemented using the `Encoder` type class from the `io.circe` library, and it encodes the `boxes` and `changeBoxes` fields as JSON objects."
