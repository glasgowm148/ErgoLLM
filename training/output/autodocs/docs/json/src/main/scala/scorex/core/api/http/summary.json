      "summary": "The code defines a trait called `ApiDirectives` that provides functionality for handling HTTP requests in the ergo project. The trait extends two other traits, `CorsHandler` and `ScorexEncoding`, which provide functionality for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and encoding data using the Scorex encoding scheme, respectively.\n\nThe `ApiDirectives` trait defines three abstract values: `settings`, `apiKeyHeaderName`, and `apiKeyHash`. The `settings` value is an instance of the `RESTApiSettings` class, which contains settings for the REST API used in the ergo project. The `apiKeyHeaderName` value is a string that represents the name of the HTTP header that contains the API key. The `apiKeyHash` value is a string that represents the hash of the API key.\n\nThe trait also defines a lazy value called `withAuth`, which is a directive that can be used to authenticate HTTP requests. The `withAuth` directive first extracts the value of the `apiKeyHeaderName` HTTP header using the `optionalHeaderValueByName` directive. If the `apiKeyHash` value is empty, the request is allowed to pass through without authentication. If the `apiKeyHeaderName` value is not present in the HTTP headers, the request is rejected with an `AuthorizationFailedRejection`. If the `apiKeyHeaderName` value is present, the API key is hashed using the Blake2b256 algorithm and encoded using the Scorex encoding scheme. If the resulting hash matches the `apiKeyHash` value, the request is allowed to pass through. Otherwise, the request is rejected with an `AuthorizationFailedRejection`.\n\nThis trait can be used in the larger ergo project to provide authentication functionality for HTTP requests. For example, a route in the ergo project that requires authentication can use the `withAuth` directive to ensure that only authorized requests are allowed to access the route. Here is an example of how the `withAuth` directive can be used in a route:\n\n```\nval myRoute = path(\"myRoute\") {\n  withAuth {\n    complete(\"Authenticated!\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `myRoute` route requires authentication using the `withAuth` directive. If the request is authenticated, the route returns a response with the message \"Authenticated!\". If the request is not authenticated, the `AuthorizationFailedRejection` is returned.",

When a request is made to the Ergo API, it may be rejected for various reasons, such as invalid authentication, missing query parameters, or unsupported URI schemes. The `ApiRejectionHandler` object defines how these rejections should be handled and what error messages should be returned to the client.\n\nThe `ApiRejectionHandler` object defines an implicit `RejectionHandler` that is used by the Akka HTTP server to handle rejections. The `RejectionHandler` is built using a series of `handle` and `handleAll` directives that match specific types of rejections and define how they should be handled. For example, the `handleAll[SchemeRejection]` directive matches all `SchemeRejection` rejections and returns a `BadRequest` error message that lists the supported URI schemes. Similarly, the `handle { case AuthorizationFailedRejection => ... }` directive matches `AuthorizationFailedRejection` rejections and returns a `Forbidden` error message indicating that the authentication is not authorized to access the requested resource.\n\nThe `ApiRejectionHandler` object also defines a `handleNotFound` directive that matches requests that could not be handled by any of the previous directives. This directive returns a `BadRequest` error message indicating that the requested resource or endpoint could not be found.\n\nOverall, the `ApiRejectionHandler` object plays an important role in ensuring that clients receive informative error messages when their requests are rejected by the Ergo API. By defining how different types of rejections should be handled, the `ApiRejectionHandler` object helps to make the Ergo API more user-friendly and easier to debug. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport akka.http.scaladsl.server._\nimport scorex.core.api.http.ApiRejectionHandler\n\nval rejectionHandler: RejectionHandler = ApiRejectionHandler.rejectionHandler\n\n// Use the rejection handler in an Akka HTTP route\nval route: Route = path(\"example\") {\n  get {\n    // Perform some action that may result in a rejection\n    complete(\"Example response\")\n  }\n}.handleRejections(rejectionHandler)\n```",

A route in the Ergo project that requires authentication can use the `withAuth` directive to ensure that only authorized requests are allowed to access the route:\n\n```scala\nval myRoute = path(\"myRoute\") {\n  withAuth {\n    complete(\"Authenticated!\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `ApiError.scala` file provides a simple and flexible way to handle HTTP errors in the Ergo project's API. It can be used to catch exceptions and return appropriate error messages:\n\n```scala\nval route: Route = path(\"example\") {\n  get {\n    try {\n      // ...\n    } catch {\n      case e: Exception => ApiError.InternalError(e)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `CompositeHttpService.scala` class can be used to combine multiple routes into a single route and serve them as a composite HTTP service. This is useful for providing a unified API for various components of the system:\n\n```scala\nval compositeHttpService = new CompositeHttpService(actorSystem, apiRoutes, restApiSettings, swaggerConf)\nval combinedRoute = compositeHttpService.compositeRoute\n```\n\nThe `CorsHandler.scala` trait provides tools for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) spec workflow, allowing developers to easily handle CORS requests and responses in an Akka HTTP server:\n\n```scala\nval myRoute: Route = path(\"myPath\") {\n  // route logic here\n}\n\nval corsRoute: Route = corsHandler(myRoute)\n```\n\nThe `swagger` subfolder contains the `SwaggerConfigRoute.scala` file, which is responsible for providing a route to serve the Swagger configuration file. This enables developers to access the Swagger documentation for the API and test the endpoints:\n\n```scala\nval swaggerConf = \"{ \\\"swagger\\\": \\\"2.0\\\", ... }\"\nval settings = RESTApiSettings()\nval swaggerRoute = new SwaggerConfigRoute(swaggerConf, settings)\n\nval routes = swaggerRoute.route\n```\n\nOverall, the code in this folder plays a crucial role in building and managing the HTTP API for the Ergo project. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that make it easier for developers to create, test, and debug API endpoints, handle errors, and ensure a smooth user experience.",
