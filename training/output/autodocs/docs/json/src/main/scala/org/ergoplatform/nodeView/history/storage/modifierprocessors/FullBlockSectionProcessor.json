  "summary": "The `FullBlockSectionProcessor` trait is used to implement `BlockSectionProcessor` interfaces for regimes where the node downloads and processes full blocks. The purpose of this code is to process a block section and construct a full block with the block section if possible. If it is not possible to construct a full block with the block section, the block section is just put into storage. \n\nThe `process` method takes a `NonHeaderBlockSection` as input and tries to construct a full block with the block section. If the block section is an `ADProofs` in UTXO mode, it is just put into storage. If the block section is not an `ADProofs` in UTXO mode, the method tries to construct a full block with the block section. If it is possible to construct a full block with the block section, the `processFullBlock` method is called to process the new full block. If it is not possible to construct a full block with the block section, the block section is just put into storage. \n\nThe `validate` method is used to validate the block section. It takes a `NonHeaderBlockSection` as input and validates it. The method first tries to get the header of the block section by its ID. If the header is found, the `PayloadValidator` is used to validate the block section. If the header is not found, the block section cannot be validated without a corresponding header. In this case, the method returns an error message. \n\nThe `getFullBlockByBlockSection` method is used to construct a full block with the block section. It takes a `NonHeaderBlockSection` as input and tries to construct a full block with the block section and data kept in history. If it is possible to construct a full block with the block section, the method returns the full block. If it is not possible to construct a full block with the block section, the method returns `None`. \n\nThe `justPutToHistory` method is used to put a block section into storage. It takes a `NonHeaderBlockSection` as input and puts the block section into storage. \n\nThe `PayloadValidator` class is used to validate `BlockTransactions`, `ADProofs`, and `Extension`. It has a `validate` method that takes a `NonHeaderBlockSection` and a `Header` as input and validates the block section. The method first checks if the block section has already been applied. If the block section has already been applied, the method returns an error message. The method then checks if the block section corresponds to the header. If the block section does not correspond to the header, the method returns an error message. The method then checks if the header is semantically valid. If the header is not semantically valid, the method returns an error message. The method then checks if the headers chain is synced. If the headers chain is not synced, the method returns an error message. The method then checks if the block section is too old. If the block section is too old, the method returns an error message.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `FullBlockSectionProcessor` trait?\n- The `FullBlockSectionProcessor` trait implements `BlockSectionProcessor` interfaces for regimes where the node downloads and processes full blocks.\n\n2. What is the `process` method doing?\n- The `process` method takes a `NonHeaderBlockSection` as input, and if the modifier is ADProofs in UTXO mode, it just puts it to storage. Otherwise, it tries to construct a full block with this block section, and if possible, processes this new full block. If not, it just puts the new block section to storage.\n\n3. What is the `PayloadValidator` class used for?\n- The `PayloadValidator` class is a validator for `BlockTransactions`, `ADProofs`, and `Extension`. It validates whether the block section corresponds to the header, whether the header is semantically valid, whether the headers chain is synced, and whether the block is too old."
