The `peerInfo` field is optional and may be `None` if the peer is connected but has not yet completed the handshake process.\n\nThe `ConnectedPeer` class overrides the `hashCode`, `equals`, and `toString` methods. The `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the remote address of the connection. The `equals` method compares the remote address of the connection with another `ConnectedPeer` object. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `ConnectedPeer` object, including the connection information and the remote version of the peer.\n\nThe `ConnectedPeer` object contains an implicit `jsonEncoder` that encodes a `ConnectedPeer` object as a JSON object. The JSON object contains the remote address of the connection (`address`) and optional fields for the remote version of the peer (`version`) and the timestamp of the last received message (`lastMessage`). The `jsonEncoder` is used to encode `ConnectedPeer` objects as JSON when sending messages between nodes in the network.\n\nOverall, the `ConnectedPeer` class and object provide a way to represent and encode information about peers that are connected to the node.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to differentiate between incoming and outgoing network connections in the `ergo` project.\n\nThe `ConnectionDirection` trait has two methods: `isIncoming` and `isOutgoing`. The former returns a boolean value indicating whether the connection is incoming, while the latter returns the opposite value by negating the result of `isIncoming`. This allows for easy checking of the direction of a connection.\n\nThe `Incoming` and `Outgoing` case objects both extend the `ConnectionDirection` trait and provide an implementation for the `isIncoming` method. `Incoming` sets its value to `true`, indicating that it represents an incoming connection, while `Outgoing` sets its value to `false`, indicating that it represents an outgoing connection.\n\nThis code can be used throughout the `ergo` project to determine the direction of network connections. For example, it could be used in a method that processes incoming network messages differently than outgoing messages.

In a typical success path, a modifier will transition from Unknown -> Requested -> Received -> Held.

It also provides methods to transition between these states and performs checks to ensure that the transitions are valid.\n\n2. **How does the `DeliveryTracker` handle invalid modifiers?**\n\n   The `DeliveryTracker` uses a Bloom Filter based cache (`invalidModifierCache`) to store invalid modifier ids. When a modifier is marked as invalid, it is added to this cache. The cache has a configurable size and expiration time, which can be set in the `NetworkCacheSettings`.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `isCorrectTransition` function?**\n\n   The `isCorrectTransition` function checks if a transition between two modifier statuses is valid. It ensures that the modifier follows the correct state transition rules, such as going from Unknown to Requested, Requested to Received, and so on. If an invalid transition is detected, it logs an error message to help developers identify the issue."

The method attempts to parse the message from the remote peer into its class representation and uses the defined message handlers for processing the message.

The UPnP protocol is used to discover and communicate with devices on a local network, such as routers, and to request that they forward incoming network traffic to a specific port on a specific device. This is useful for applications that need to receive incoming network connections, such as peer-to-peer networks, online gaming, and remote desktop applications.\n\nThe `UPnPGateway` trait defines four methods: `localAddress`, which returns the local IP address of the gateway device; `externalAddress`, which returns the external IP address of the gateway device; `addPort`, which requests that the gateway device forward incoming traffic on a specific port to the local device; and `deletePort`, which removes a port mapping. The `UPnP` object provides a method `getValidGateway` that searches for a UPnP gateway device on the local network and returns an instance of `UPnPGatewayImpl` if one is found.\n\nThe `UPnPGatewayImpl` class implements the `UPnPGateway` trait and provides concrete implementations of the four methods. The constructor takes a `GatewayDevice` object, which represents a UPnP gateway device, and initializes the `localAddress` and `externalAddress` fields. The `addPort` method requests that the gateway device forward incoming traffic on a specific port to the local device. The `deletePort` method removes a port mapping. The `getLocalAddressForExternalPort` method returns the local IP address and port number of the device that is mapped to a specific external port on the gateway device.\n\nThis code is used in the larger project to enable incoming network connections to the nodes in the network. When a node starts up, it calls the `getValidGateway` method to discover a UPnP gateway device on the local network. If a device is found, the node calls the `addPort` method to request that the device forward incoming traffic on a specific port to the node. This allows other nodes on the network to connect to the node and exchange data. When the node shuts down, it calls the `deletePort` method to remove the port mapping. The `getLocalAddressForExternalPort` method is used to determine the local IP address and port number of a node that is mapped to a specific external port on the gateway device. This is useful for debugging and monitoring the network. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval settings: NetworkSettings = ???\nval gateway: Option[UPnPGateway] = UPnP.getValidGateway(settings)\ngateway.foreach(_.addPort(9000))\n// wait for incoming connections on port 9000\ngateway.foreach(_.deletePort(9000))\n```",

This class is an essential part of the Ergo project's networking layer, allowing secure and reliable communication between nodes.\n\n`MessageSpec.scala` defines two traits, `MessageSpec` and `MessageSpecV1`, used for implementing peer-to-peer (p2p) messages in the Ergo network. Developers can create their own message types by extending these traits and defining their own properties.\n\nHere's an example of how the code in this folder might be used:\n\n```scala\nval serializer = new MessageSerializer(Seq(MyMessageSpec), Array(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78))\nval message = MyMessage(data)\nval serialized = serializer.serialize(message)\nval deserialized = serializer.deserialize(serialized, Some(peer))\n```\n\nIn this example, a `MessageSerializer` is created with a custom `MyMessageSpec` and magicBytes. A `MyMessage` instance is created with some data, serialized using the `serialize` method, and then deserialized using the `deserialize` method.\n\nOverall, the code in this folder plays a vital role in the Ergo project by defining the structure and serialization logic of network messages, enabling efficient and secure communication between nodes in the Ergo blockchain network.",
