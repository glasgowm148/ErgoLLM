  "summary": "The `WalletRegistry` class in the Ergo project provides access to version-sensitive wallet-specific indexes. It is responsible for managing wallet-related data, such as transactions, boxes (spent or unspent), and wallet status (height, balances). The class also provides methods for updating the wallet state based on new blocks and rolling back to a previous state.\n\nSome key methods in this class include:\n\n- `getBox(id: BoxId)`: Retrieves a wallet-related box with metadata by its identifier.\n- `allUnspentBoxes()`: Returns all unspent boxes in the wallet.\n- `unspentBoxes(scanId: ScanId)`: Returns unspent boxes related to a specific scan.\n- `walletUnspentBoxes()`: Returns unspent boxes belonging to the wallet (payments scan).\n- `getTx(id: ModifierId)`: Retrieves a wallet-related transaction with metadata by its identifier.\n- `allWalletTxs()`: Returns all wallet-related transactions.\n- `updateOnBlock(scanResults: ScanResults, blockId: ModifierId, blockHeight: Int)`: Updates the wallet state based on the data extracted from a block.\n\nThe `WalletRegistry` class also provides methods for updating the scans associated with a box, removing a scan from a box, and updating the wallet digest (aggregate wallet information).\n\nExample usage of the `WalletRegistry` class:\n\n```scala\nval walletRegistry = WalletRegistry(settings)\nval unspentBoxes = walletRegistry.allUnspentBoxes()\nval walletTransaction = walletRegistry.getTx(transactionId)\nwalletRegistry.updateOnBlock(scanResults, blockId, blockHeight)\n```\n\nIn summary, the `WalletRegistry` class is a crucial component in the Ergo project for managing wallet-related data and updating the wallet state based on new blocks and transactions.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `WalletRegistry` class?**\n\n   The `WalletRegistry` class provides access to version-sensitive wallet-specific indexes, such as the current wallet status (height, balances), wallet-related transactions, and boxes (spent or not). It handles the storage and retrieval of wallet-related data and updates the wallet state based on new blocks and transactions.\n\n2. **How does the `updateOnBlock` method work?**\n\n   The `updateOnBlock` method updates the wallet state based on the data extracted from a block (outputs created and spent along with corresponding transactions). It updates the wallet-specific indexes, such as unspent and spent boxes, transactions, and wallet digest (height, balances). The method performs a versioned update to maintain the history of changes.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `KeyValuePairsBag` class?**\n\n   The `KeyValuePairsBag` class is a helper class that collects data for versioned database updates. It holds key-value pairs to be inserted and keys to be removed from the database. It provides methods to apply these updates to a given `LDBVersionedStore`, either as a versioned or non-versioned transaction."
