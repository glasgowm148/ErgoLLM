  "summary": "The `ErgoWalletSupport` trait provides functionality for managing and processing transactions in the Ergo platform. It includes methods for unlocking the wallet, generating unsigned transactions, and handling asset issuance requests.\n\nThe `processUnlock` method is responsible for unlocking the wallet by converting legacy client paths, reading public keys from the storage, and updating the wallet state with the new public keys. If no public keys are found in the storage, it derives the next key for the master key and adds it to the storage.\n\nThe `requestsToBoxCandidates` method converts transaction requests (payments or asset issuance) into transaction outputs. It checks if the input sequence contains only one asset issuance request and ensures that auxiliary registers do not try to rewrite registers R0...R6.\n\nThe `generateUnsignedTransaction` method generates a new unsigned transaction according to the given requests using stored or provided boxes. It filters out burnTokens requests and merges them with the tokens on the whitelist. It then selects input boxes based on the target balance and assets, and prepares the unsigned transaction using the selected input boxes, data inputs, and change address.\n\nHere's an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n1. Unlock the wallet using the `processUnlock` method.\n2. Generate a new unsigned transaction using the `generateUnsignedTransaction` method with the desired transaction requests (payments or asset issuance).\n3. Sign the unsigned transaction using the wallet's private key.\n4. Broadcast the signed transaction to the Ergo network.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoWalletSupport` trait plays a crucial role in managing transactions and wallet operations in the Ergo platform.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `mergeBurnWhitelistTokens` function and how does it work?\n   **Answer**: The `mergeBurnWhitelistTokens` function is used to merge the tokens from a burn request with the auto-burn mechanism. It filters out tokens on the whitelist from the wallet and merges the rest with the burnTokens from the requests.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `generateUnsignedTransaction` function work and what are its inputs and outputs?\n   **Answer**: The `generateUnsignedTransaction` function generates a new unsigned transaction according to the given requests using stored or provided boxes. It takes the wallet state, box selector, requests, inputsRaw, and dataInputsRaw as inputs, and returns a tuple containing the generated unsigned transaction, its input boxes, and data-input boxes, or an error if the inputs are incorrect.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `requestsToBoxCandidates` function and how does it handle different types of requests?\n   **Answer**: The `requestsToBoxCandidates` function is used to convert requests (to make payments or to issue an asset) into transaction outputs. It handles different types of requests such as PaymentRequest, AssetIssueRequest, and others by creating appropriate ErgoBoxCandidate instances for each request type."
