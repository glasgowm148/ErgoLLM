  "summary": "This code is a LaTeX document that serves as the technical documentation for the Ergo project. Ergo is a platform for creating and executing smart contracts on a blockchain. The document provides an overview of the platform's features and design principles.\n\nThe document is divided into several sections, each of which covers a different aspect of the Ergo platform. The \"social contract\" section describes the platform's governance model, which is designed to ensure that the platform remains decentralized and resistant to censorship. The \"autolykos\" section describes the proof-of-work algorithm used by the Ergo blockchain, which is designed to be memory-hard and resistant to ASIC mining. The \"utxo\" section describes the platform's unspent transaction output model, which is used to track the ownership of assets on the blockchain.\n\nThe document also covers the platform's survivability features, which are designed to ensure that the blockchain remains operational even in the face of attacks or network failures. The \"currency\" section describes the platform's native currency, which is used to pay for transaction fees and to incentivize miners. The \"money\" section describes the platform's approach to creating and managing digital assets, which can be used to represent a wide range of real-world assets.\n\nOverall, this document serves as a comprehensive guide to the Ergo platform, providing developers and users with the information they need to understand how the platform works and how to use it to create and execute smart contracts.",
