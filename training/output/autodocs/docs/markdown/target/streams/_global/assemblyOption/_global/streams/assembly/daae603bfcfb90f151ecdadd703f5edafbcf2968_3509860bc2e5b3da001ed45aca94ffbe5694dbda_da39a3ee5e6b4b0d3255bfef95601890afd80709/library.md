The `shell.welcome` property appears to define a welcome message that is displayed when the project is run. The message is a stylized ASCII art representation of the project name, "ergo". 

The `copyright.string` property defines the copyright information for the project, indicating that it is owned by LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc. 

The `version.number` property specifies the version number of the project, which is currently set to 2.12.10. This could be useful for tracking changes and updates to the project over time. 

The `osgi.version.number` property appears to be related to the OSGi framework, which is a modular system for Java that allows for dynamic loading and unloading of code modules. This property specifies a version number for the OSGi bundle associated with the project. 

Finally, the `maven.version.number` property specifies the version number of the Maven build tool that is being used for the project. Maven is a popular build automation tool for Java projects, and this property could be useful for ensuring compatibility with different versions of Maven.
