The `akka-http-version.conf` file in the ergo project sets the version of Akka HTTP to be used throughout the application. Akka HTTP is a toolkit for building HTTP-based applications and services in Scala. By specifying the version as "10.2.4", the ergo project ensures that all its components relying on Akka HTTP will use the features and bug fixes included in that specific version, preventing any version conflicts or inconsistencies.

This configuration file is likely part of a larger configuration setup for the ergo project, such as an `application.conf` file. By setting the Akka HTTP version in this file, it ensures that all components of the ergo project that rely on Akka HTTP will use the same version.

For example, consider the following code snippet that uses Akka HTTP to define a simple HTTP route:

```scala
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.Directives._
import akka.http.scaladsl.server.Route

object MyRoutes {
  val route: Route =
    path("hello") {
      get {
        complete("Hello, world!")
      }
    }
}
```

In this example, the ergo project is using Akka HTTP to define a simple HTTP route that responds with "Hello, world!" when the path "/hello" is requested. By importing the necessary Akka HTTP directives and using them to define the route, the ergo project can take advantage of the features and functionality provided by Akka HTTP, such as routing and request handling. The version of Akka HTTP used in this example would be the one set in the `akka-http-version.conf` file.

By having a centralized configuration for the Akka HTTP version, developers working on the ergo project can ensure that they are using the correct version of the library throughout the application. This helps maintain consistency and avoid potential issues that could arise from using different versions of the library in different parts of the project.
