This code contains the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1, which is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The LGPL is designed to allow developers to use and integrate specific software libraries into their projects, while ensuring that the libraries remain free and open-source.

The LGPL differs from the more restrictive GNU General Public License (GPL) in that it permits linking the licensed libraries with non-free programs. This is useful in cases where a library needs to be widely adopted as a standard or when a free library serves the same purpose as a non-free one.

The license outlines the terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification of the software library. It ensures that users have the freedom to distribute copies of the software, access the source code, modify the software, and use parts of it in new free programs. It also imposes certain responsibilities on distributors, such as providing the source code and object files to recipients, and informing them of their rights under the LGPL.

To apply the LGPL to a new library, developers should attach the license notices to the start of each source file, include a copyright line, and provide contact information. They may also need to obtain a copyright disclaimer from their employer or school if necessary.

In summary, the LGPL allows for more flexibility in using and distributing free software libraries, while still ensuring that the libraries remain free and open-source. This promotes the sharing and reuse of software, benefiting both developers and users.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the GNU Lesser General Public License?**

   The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a software license designed to guarantee the freedom to share and change free software, while also allowing for linking with non-free programs. It is typically applied to libraries and other software packages that are intended to be used in conjunction with both free and non-free software.

2. **How does the LGPL differ from the ordinary GNU General Public License (GPL)?**

   The LGPL is less restrictive than the GPL, allowing for more lax criteria when it comes to linking other code with the library. This makes it possible to link LGPL-licensed libraries with non-free programs, which is not allowed under the GPL. However, the LGPL is also less protective of the user's freedom and provides less advantage to other free software developers compared to the GPL.

3. **How can I apply the LGPL to my own library?**

   To apply the LGPL to your library, you need to attach the appropriate notices to the library, including a copyright notice, a brief description of the library, and a statement that the library is licensed under the LGPL. You should also include a copy of the LGPL with your library and provide information on how to contact you. If necessary, you may need to obtain a copyright disclaimer from your employer or school.
