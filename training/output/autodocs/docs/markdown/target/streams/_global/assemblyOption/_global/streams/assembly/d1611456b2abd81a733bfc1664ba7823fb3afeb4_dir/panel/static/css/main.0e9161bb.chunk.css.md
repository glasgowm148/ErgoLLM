This code is responsible for styling the user interface of the Ergo project. It imports various SCSS files, such as `_normalize.scss`, `_fonts.scss`, `variables`, `button`, and `infoModal`, which contain styles for different components and utilities used throughout the project.

The main focus of this code is to apply consistent styles across different elements, such as fonts, buttons, and modals. It also includes some utility functions, like the `rem` function, which is used to convert pixel values to rem units for better responsiveness.

For example, the `button` component has different sizes (large, medium, and small) and variations (primary, secondary, and close). The styles for these buttons are defined in the `components/button.scss` file, which is imported and used in the main code.

Another important component is the `infoModal`, which is a modal dialog with a backdrop. The styles for this component are defined in the `components/infoModal.scss` file. It includes styles for the modal's content, buttons, and close button, as well as responsive styles for different screen sizes.

The code also includes some global styles, such as setting the `box-sizing` property to `border-box` for all elements, and defining the default font family as 'Roboto'. Additionally, it includes styles for normalizing the appearance of various HTML elements across different browsers, such as headings, lists, links, and form elements.

Overall, this code ensures a consistent and responsive user interface for the Ergo project by applying styles to various components and elements.

It also imports some external stylesheets, like normalize.css and custom font styles.

2. **What are the imported stylesheets used for?**

   The imported stylesheets serve different purposes: `_normalize.scss` is used to reset and normalize the default styles of various HTML elements across different browsers; `_fonts.scss` is used to define custom font faces for the project; `variables` is likely used to define global variables for the project, such as colors and breakpoints; and the other imports are for specific components like buttons and modals.

3. **How are the styles organized in this code?**

   The styles are organized into different sections, starting with imports for external stylesheets, followed by general styles for elements like headings, links, and lists. Then, there are specific styles for components like buttons and modals. The code also includes some utility functions and media queries for responsive design.
