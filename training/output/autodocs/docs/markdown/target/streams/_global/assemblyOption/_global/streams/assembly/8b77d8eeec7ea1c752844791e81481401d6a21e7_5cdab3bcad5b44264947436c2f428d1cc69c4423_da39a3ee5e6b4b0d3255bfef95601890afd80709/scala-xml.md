This file contains configuration information for the ergo project. Specifically, it sets the version number and the Scala version used in the project. 

The `version.number` field sets the version of the ergo project to 1.3.0. This is important for tracking changes and updates to the project over time. 

The `scala.version.number` and `scala.binary.version.number` fields specify the version of Scala used in the project. In this case, the project is using Scala version 2.12.10, which is the latest version of Scala 2.12. The `scala.binary.version.number` field specifies the major version of Scala, which is 2.12 in this case. 

This configuration file is important for ensuring that the ergo project is using the correct versions of Scala and other dependencies. It can also be used to specify other configuration options for the project, such as logging settings or database connection information. 

Here is an example of how this configuration file might be used in the larger ergo project:

```scala
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory

object ErgoApp {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val config = ConfigFactory.load()
    val version = config.getString("version.number")
    val scalaVersion = config.getString("scala.version.number")
    println(s"Ergo version $version running on Scala $scalaVersion")
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the Typesafe Config library to load the configuration information from this file. We then extract the `version.number` and `scala.version.number` fields and use them to print out information about the current version of the ergo project and the version of Scala being used. This information could be useful for debugging or troubleshooting issues in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this file?**\
A smart developer might wonder what this file is used for within the `ergo` project. Based on the content, it appears to be a configuration file that specifies the version of Scala being used and the version of the `ergo` project itself.

2. **What other configuration files are used in the `ergo` project?**\
A smart developer might want to know if there are other configuration files used in the `ergo` project and how they interact with this file. This information would provide a better understanding of the overall project structure and dependencies.

3. **What changes have been made to this file since its creation?**\
A smart developer might be interested in knowing if any changes have been made to this file since it was created on March 16, 2020. This information would be useful in tracking the evolution of the project and identifying any potential issues or bugs that may have been introduced.
