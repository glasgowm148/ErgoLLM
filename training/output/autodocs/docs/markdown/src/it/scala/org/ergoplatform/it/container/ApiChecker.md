The code above defines two case classes, `ApiCheckerConfig` and `ApiChecker`, which are used to configure and run an API checker for the Ergo platform. The `ApiCheckerConfig` case class takes in three parameters: `apiAddressToCheck`, `specFilePath`, and `paramsFilePath`. `apiAddressToCheck` is a string that specifies the address of the API to be checked. `specFilePath` is a string that specifies the path to the file containing the API specification, and `paramsFilePath` is a string that specifies the path to the file containing the API parameters. 

The `ApiChecker` case class takes in two parameters: `containerId` and `config`. `containerId` is a string that specifies the ID of the container in which the API is running. `config` is an instance of the `ApiCheckerConfig` case class, which contains the configuration parameters for the API checker.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to check the API of the Ergo platform to ensure that it is functioning correctly. The `ApiChecker` case class can be used to create an instance of the API checker, which can then be run to check the API. The `ApiCheckerConfig` case class allows for customization of the API checker by specifying the API address, specification file path, and parameters file path.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger Ergo project:

```scala
val apiCheckerConfig = ApiCheckerConfig("http://localhost:8080/api", "/path/to/spec/file", "/path/to/params/file")
val apiChecker = ApiChecker("container123", apiCheckerConfig)
apiChecker.run()
```

In this example, an instance of `ApiCheckerConfig` is created with the API address set to `http://localhost:8080/api`, and the paths to the specification and parameters files set to `/path/to/spec/file` and `/path/to/params/file`, respectively. An instance of `ApiChecker` is then created with the container ID set to `container123` and the `ApiCheckerConfig` instance passed in as the configuration. Finally, the `run()` method is called on the `ApiChecker` instance to run the API checker.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ApiChecker` class and how is it used within the `ergo` project?
   - The `ApiChecker` class is used to check the API address specified in the `ApiCheckerConfig` against the OpenAPI specification and parameters files. It is likely used to ensure that the API is functioning correctly and adhering to the specified contract.
2. What is the expected format of the `specFilePath` and `paramsFilePath` parameters in the `ApiCheckerConfig` case class?
   - Without additional context, it is unclear what format the `specFilePath` and `paramsFilePath` parameters should be in. It is possible that they are file paths to JSON or YAML files, but this cannot be determined from the code alone.
3. How is the `ApiChecker` class instantiated and used within the `ergo` project?
   - Without additional context, it is unclear how the `ApiChecker` class is instantiated and used within the `ergo` project. It is possible that it is instantiated and used within a test suite or as part of a monitoring system, but this cannot be determined from the code alone.
