The `UtxoStateNodesSyncSpec` class is a test suite that checks the synchronization of UTXO state nodes in the Ergo platform. The test suite extends the `AnyFlatSpec` class and uses the `IntegrationSuite` trait, which provides the necessary setup for running the tests. 

The test suite defines a few variables, including the number of blocks to be generated (`blocksQty`), the depth of the fork (`forkDepth`), and the configuration of the nodes (`minerConfig`, `nonGeneratingConfig`, and `onlineGeneratingConfigs`). It also creates a list of `Node` objects by starting the Docker containers with the specified configurations.

The test case defined in the suite checks the synchronization of UTXO state nodes by performing the following steps:

1. It retrieves the current height of each node by calling the `fullHeight` method on each node and takes the maximum of the heights.
2. It waits for all nodes to reach a height that is `blocksQty` higher than the initial height.
3. It retrieves the header IDs of the blocks at a height that is `blocksQty - forkDepth` higher than the initial height.
4. It checks that all nodes have the same header ID at the specified height.

The test case uses the `Future` API to perform the asynchronous operations and the `Await` method to wait for the results. The test case is expected to complete within 15 minutes.

This test suite is an important part of the Ergo platform as it ensures that the UTXO state nodes are synchronized correctly. The UTXO state is a critical component of the Ergo blockchain, and any inconsistency in the state can lead to serious issues such as double-spending. By running this test suite, the developers can ensure that the nodes are working correctly and that the UTXO state is consistent across all nodes. 

Example usage:

```scala
val utxoStateNodesSyncSpec = new UtxoStateNodesSyncSpec()
utxoStateNodesSyncSpec.execute()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UtxoStateNodesSyncSpec` class?
- The `UtxoStateNodesSyncSpec` class is a test suite that checks the synchronization of UTXO state nodes.

2. What dependencies are being imported in this file?
- This file imports `com.typesafe.config.Config`, `org.ergoplatform.it.container.{IntegrationSuite, Node}`, and `org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec`.

3. What is the purpose of the `Await.result` method call at the end of the `it` block?
- The `Await.result` method call is used to wait for the completion of the `result` future, which contains the test logic. It waits for a maximum of 15 minutes for the future to complete.
