The `NetworkController` class in the Ergo project is responsible for managing all network interactions, including establishing and maintaining connections with peers, handling incoming and outgoing messages, and managing the lifecycle of child actors. It is designed to be a singleton, ensuring that only one instance of the class is created.

The class constructor takes several parameters, including the Ergo settings, a reference to the `PeerManager` actor, the `ScorexContext`, a reference to the `TcpManager` actor, and a partial function for handling messages. The class also defines several message types that can be received and processed by the `NetworkController`.

The main functionality of the `NetworkController` is implemented in the `receive` method, which defines several partial functions for handling different types of messages. These include:

- `bindingLogic`: Handles binding to a network port and scheduling periodic tasks, such as connecting to peers and dropping dead connections.
- `businessLogic`: Processes incoming messages from other peers and forwards them to the appropriate handler.
- `peerCommands`: Handles commands related to connecting, disconnecting, and penalizing peers.
- `connectionEvents`: Manages events related to establishing and terminating connections with peers.
- `interfaceCalls`: Handles calls from the API or application, such as getting the status of connected peers or shutting down the network.
- `nonsense`: Handles unexpected input and logs a warning.

The `NetworkController` also includes several utility methods for managing connections, such as `connectTo`, `createPeerConnectionHandler`, and `handleHandshake`. These methods are used to establish and maintain connections with peers, as well as to handle the handshake process when a new connection is established.

In addition to managing connections, the `NetworkController` also schedules periodic tasks to maintain the health of the network. These tasks include connecting to random peers, evicting random connections to prevent eclipsing attacks, and dropping dead connections that have been inactive for a specified period.

Overall, the `NetworkController` plays a crucial role in managing the network interactions of the Ergo project, ensuring that the node can communicate effectively with its peers and maintain a healthy network state.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `NetworkController` class?
   **Answer**: The `NetworkController` class is responsible for controlling all network interactions in the Ergo project. It manages connections to peers, handles incoming and outgoing messages, and maintains the state of connected peers.

2. **Question**: How does the `NetworkController` handle incoming messages from other peers?
   **Answer**: When the `NetworkController` receives a message from another peer, it looks up the appropriate message handler based on the message code and forwards the message to that handler for processing.

3. **Question**: How does the `NetworkController` manage connections to peers?
   **Answer**: The `NetworkController` maintains a map of connections to peers, represented by `ConnectedPeer` instances. It periodically schedules connection attempts to random known peers, evicts random connections to prevent eclipsing, and drops dead connections based on their inactivity.
