[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/nodeView/wallet/requests/BurnTokensRequest.scala)

The code defines a request for asset burning in the Ergo platform's wallet. The `BurnTokensRequest` class takes a sequence of token IDs and amounts to burn as input. This class extends the `TransactionGenerationRequest` trait, which is used to generate transactions in the Ergo platform's wallet.

The `BurnTokensRequestEncoder` and `BurnTokensRequestDecoder` classes are used to encode and decode instances of the `BurnTokensRequest` class to and from JSON format. The `BurnTokensRequestEncoder` class takes a `BurnTokensRequest` instance and returns a JSON object with the `assetsToBurn` field set to the input's `assetsToBurn` field. The `BurnTokensRequestDecoder` class takes a JSON object and returns a `BurnTokensRequest` instance with the `assetsToBurn` field set to the `assetsToBurn` field of the input JSON object.

This code is used in the larger Ergo platform project to enable users to burn assets in their wallets. The `BurnTokensRequest` class is used to define the input to the asset burning process, while the `BurnTokensRequestEncoder` and `BurnTokensRequestDecoder` classes are used to encode and decode the input to and from JSON format. This code is an important part of the Ergo platform's wallet functionality, as it enables users to manage their assets and perform transactions on the platform. 

Example usage:

```scala
val request = BurnTokensRequest(Seq(("token1", 10L), ("token2", 5L)))
val encoder = new BurnTokensRequestEncoder()
val json = encoder(request).toString()
// json: String = {"assetsToBurn":[["token1",10],["token2",5]]}

val decoder = new BurnTokensRequestDecoder()
val decodedRequest = decoder.decodeJson(json).right.get
// decodedRequest: BurnTokensRequest = BurnTokensRequest(Seq(("token1", 10L), ("token2", 5L)))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall ergo project?
   - This code defines a request for asset burning in the ergo wallet and provides encoders and decoders for the request. It is part of the wallet functionality in the ergo project.
   
2. What is the format of the input required for the `BurnTokensRequest` class?
   - The `BurnTokensRequest` class takes in a sequence of token ids and amounts to burn, represented as a tuple of `ErgoBox.TokenId` and `Long`.
   
3. What is the purpose of the `BurnTokensRequestEncoder` and `BurnTokensRequestDecoder` classes?
   - The `BurnTokensRequestEncoder` and `BurnTokensRequestDecoder` classes provide functionality to encode and decode `BurnTokensRequest` objects to and from JSON format, respectively.
