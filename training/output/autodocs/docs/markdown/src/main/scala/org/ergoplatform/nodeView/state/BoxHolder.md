The `BoxHolder` class is an in-memory storage for ErgoBox objects, which are immutable boxes that contain assets and data. This class is useful for storing genesis state and for testing purposes, but it is not suitable for big collections. The boxes are stored in an immutable sorted collection, organized as a map of box.key -> box. 

The `BoxHolder` class provides several methods for manipulating the boxes. The `size` method returns the number of boxes in the collection. The `get` method takes a ByteArrayWrapper object as input and returns the corresponding ErgoBox object, if it exists in the collection. The `removeBoxes` method takes a sequence of ByteArrayWrapper objects as input and removes the corresponding boxes from the collection. The `addBoxes` method takes a sequence of ErgoBox objects as input and adds them to the collection. The `take` method takes an integer or a function as input and returns a tuple containing a sequence of ErgoBox objects and a new BoxHolder object. If an integer is provided, the method returns the first `howMany` boxes in the collection. If a function is provided, the method returns the boxes that satisfy the condition specified by the function. The `sortedBoxes` method returns a set of ErgoBox objects sorted by their keys. Finally, the `toString` method returns a string representation of the BoxHolder object.

The `VersionedInMemoryBoxHolder` class is a subclass of `BoxHolder` that is used for testing purposes. It extends the `BoxHolder` class and adds support for in-memory diffs. The class takes three parameters: the boxes, the versions, and the diffs. The `applyChanges` method takes a version tag, a sequence of ByteArrayWrapper objects to remove, and a sequence of ErgoBox objects to add. It returns a new `VersionedInMemoryBoxHolder` object with the changes applied. The `rollback` method takes a version tag and rolls back the changes made after that version. It returns a new `VersionedInMemoryBoxHolder` object with the changes rolled back.

The `BoxHolder` object provides a factory method `apply` that takes a sequence of ErgoBox objects as input and returns a new `BoxHolder` object containing those boxes.

Overall, the `BoxHolder` and `VersionedInMemoryBoxHolder` classes provide a simple in-memory storage for ErgoBox objects that is useful for testing purposes and for storing small collections of boxes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BoxHolder` class?
- The `BoxHolder` class is an unauthenticated ordered in-memory box storage that is useful for storing genesis state and for tests, but not suitable for big collections.

2. What is the purpose of the `VersionedInMemoryBoxHolder` class?
- The `VersionedInMemoryBoxHolder` class is a box holder with in-memory diffs that is used for tests.

3. What is the purpose of the `applyChanges` method in the `VersionedInMemoryBoxHolder` class?
- The `applyChanges` method is used to apply changes to the box holder by removing some boxes and adding new ones, and creating a new version of the box holder with the changes.
