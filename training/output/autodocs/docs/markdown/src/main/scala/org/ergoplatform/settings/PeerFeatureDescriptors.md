The `PeerFeatureDescriptors` object is a repository of existing peer feature identifiers and their corresponding serializers. Peer features are attributes of a node in a peer-to-peer network that can be used to identify and communicate with that node. 

This object defines four peer feature identifiers: `LocalAddressPeerFeatureId`, `SessionIdPeerFeatureId`, `RestApiUrlFeatureId`, and `ModeFeatureId`. Each identifier is assigned a unique byte value. 

The object also defines a `FeatureSerializers` map that maps each identifier to its corresponding serializer. A serializer is responsible for converting a peer feature to and from a byte array, which is necessary for transmitting the feature over the network. 

The `LocalAddressPeerFeatureSerializer` serializes a `LocalAddressPeerFeature`, which represents the IP address and port number of a node. The `SessionIdPeerFeatureSerializer` serializes a `SessionIdPeerFeature`, which represents a unique identifier for a node's session. The `RestApiUrlPeerFeatureSerializer` serializes a `RestApiUrlPeerFeature`, which represents the URL of a node's REST API. Finally, the `ModeFeatureSerializer` serializes a `ModePeerFeature`, which represents the mode of a node (e.g. "regtest", "testnet", "mainnet"). 

This object is likely used in the larger project to facilitate communication between nodes in the Ergo network. When a node wants to communicate with another node, it can use the peer features to identify and establish a connection with that node. The serializers defined in this object are used to convert the peer features to a byte array that can be transmitted over the network. 

Example usage:
```
import org.ergoplatform.settings.PeerFeatureDescriptors

// Get the byte value of the LocalAddressPeerFeature identifier
val localAddressId = PeerFeatureDescriptors.LocalAddressPeerFeatureId

// Get the serializer for the LocalAddressPeerFeature
val localAddressSerializer = PeerFeatureDescriptors.FeatureSerializers(localAddressId)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a repository of existing peer feature identifiers and their corresponding serializers for the Ergo platform's network.
2. What are the different types of peer features supported by this code?
   - The code supports four different types of peer features: LocalAddressPeerFeature, SessionIdPeerFeature, RestApiUrlPeerFeature, and ModePeerFeature.
3. What is the format of the `FeatureSerializers` variable?
   - `FeatureSerializers` is a map that associates each peer feature identifier with its corresponding serializer.
