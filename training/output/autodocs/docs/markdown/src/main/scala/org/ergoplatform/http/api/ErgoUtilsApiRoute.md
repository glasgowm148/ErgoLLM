The `ErgoUtilsApiRoute` class is a part of the Ergo project and provides an API route for various utility functions. The class extends the `ApiRoute` trait and defines the `route` method, which returns a `Route` object. The `route` method defines the API endpoints for the utility functions. 

The `ErgoUtilsApiRoute` class provides the following utility functions:

1. `seedRoute` - This function generates a random seed of 32 bytes and returns it as a Base16 encoded string. The seed is generated using the `SecureRandom` class.

2. `length` - This function takes an integer as input and generates a random seed of the specified length. The seed is returned as a Base16 encoded string.

3. `hashBlake2b` - This function takes a JSON object as input and returns the Blake2b256 hash of the JSON object as a Base16 encoded string.

4. `rawToAddressR` - This function takes a Base16 encoded public key as input and returns the corresponding P2PK address.

5. `addressToRawR` - This function takes a P2PK address as input and returns the corresponding Base16 encoded public key.

6. `validateAddressGetR` and `validateAddressPostR` - These functions take a P2PK address as input and return whether the address is valid or not.

7. `ergoTreeToAddressGetR` and `ergoTreeToAddressPostR` - These functions take an ErgoTree as input and return the corresponding P2PK address.

The `ErgoUtilsApiRoute` class uses the `ErgoSettings` class to get the REST API settings. The `ErgoAddressEncoder` class is used to encode and decode P2PK addresses. The `ErgoTreeSerializer` class is used to serialize and deserialize ErgoTrees. The `Blake2b256` class is used to calculate the hash of a JSON object. The `Base16` class is used to encode and decode Base16 strings. The `ProveDlog` class is used to create a P2PK address from a public key. 

Overall, the `ErgoUtilsApiRoute` class provides a set of utility functions that can be used by other parts of the Ergo project. For example, the `rawToAddressR` function can be used by the wallet module to generate P2PK addresses from public keys. The `validateAddressGetR` function can be used by the explorer module to validate P2PK addresses.
## Questions: 
 1. What endpoints are available in this API route?
- The available endpoints are `seed`, `seed/{length}`, `hash/blake2b`, `rawToAddress/{pubKeyHex}`, `addressToRaw/{addressStr}`, `validateAddress`, and `ergoTreeToAddress`.

2. What is the purpose of the `ErgoUtilsApiRoute` class?
- The `ErgoUtilsApiRoute` class is an API route that provides utility functions for the Ergo blockchain platform, such as generating a random seed, converting between raw public keys and Ergo addresses, and validating Ergo addresses.

3. What external libraries are used in this code?
- The code uses several external libraries, including Akka HTTP, Circe, Scorex, and SigmaState.
