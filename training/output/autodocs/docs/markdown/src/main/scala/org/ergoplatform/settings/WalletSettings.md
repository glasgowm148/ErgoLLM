The `WalletSettings` class is a part of the `ergo` project and is responsible for storing and managing various settings related to the wallet functionality of the platform. The class contains a number of properties that can be used to configure the behavior of the wallet, such as `seedStrengthBits`, `mnemonicPhraseLanguage`, `usePreEip3Derivation`, `keepSpentBoxes`, `defaultTransactionFee`, `dustLimit`, `maxInputs`, `optimalInputs`, `testMnemonic`, `testKeysQty`, `tokensWhitelist`, `checkEIP27`, and `profile`.

The `secretStorage` property is an instance of the `SecretStorageSettings` class, which is used to store and manage the user's private keys and other sensitive information. The `walletProfile` property is an instance of the `WalletProfile` class, which is used to determine the type of wallet being used (e.g. user wallet, cold wallet, etc.).

The `WalletSettings` class can be used to configure the behavior of the wallet in a number of ways. For example, the `seedStrengthBits` property can be used to specify the number of bits used to generate the wallet's seed phrase, while the `mnemonicPhraseLanguage` property can be used to specify the language used for the seed phrase.

The `usePreEip3Derivation` property can be used to specify whether or not to use the pre-EIP3 derivation scheme for generating addresses, while the `keepSpentBoxes` property can be used to specify whether or not to keep spent boxes in the wallet's history.

The `defaultTransactionFee` property can be used to specify the default transaction fee for the wallet, while the `dustLimit` property can be used to specify the minimum amount of value that can be sent in a transaction.

The `maxInputs` and `optimalInputs` properties can be used to specify the maximum and optimal number of inputs to use in a transaction, respectively.

The `testMnemonic` and `testKeysQty` properties can be used for testing purposes, while the `tokensWhitelist` property can be used to specify a whitelist of tokens to be used in the wallet.

The `checkEIP27` property can be used to specify whether or not to check for the EIP27 standard when sending tokens, while the `profile` property can be used to specify the type of wallet being used.

Overall, the `WalletSettings` class provides a flexible and configurable way to manage the behavior of the wallet functionality in the `ergo` platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WalletSettings` case class?
- The `WalletSettings` case class is used to store various settings related to the wallet functionality of the Ergo platform, such as secret storage settings, transaction fee, and input/output limits.

2. What is the `walletProfile` value and how is it determined?
- The `walletProfile` value is a `WalletProfile` object that represents the profile of the wallet, which is determined based on the `profile` parameter passed to the `WalletSettings` constructor.

3. What is the significance of the `tokensWhitelist` parameter?
- The `tokensWhitelist` parameter is an optional sequence of strings that specifies a whitelist of tokens that the wallet should allow for transactions. If it is set to `Some(Seq.empty)`, all tokens are allowed, while if it is set to `Some(Seq(x))`, all tokens except `x` are allowed. If it is set to `None`, this feature is ignored.
