The `NodePanelRoute` class is a part of the `org.ergoplatform.http` package and is responsible for defining a route for the Ergo node's web panel. The route is defined using the Akka HTTP library's `Directives` trait, which provides a set of building blocks for creating HTTP routes.

The `NodePanelRoute` class has a single method called `route`, which returns an instance of the `Route` class. The `Route` class represents an HTTP route that can be used to handle incoming requests. The `route` method defines two routes using the `pathPrefix` and `getFromResource` directives.

The first route is defined using the `pathPrefix` directive, which matches requests that start with the `/panel` path segment. The `getFromResource` directive is then used to serve the `index.html` file from the `panel` directory in the classpath. This file is the main entry point for the Ergo node's web panel.

The second route is defined using the `getFromResourceDirectory` directive, which serves all the static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) from the `panel` directory in the classpath. This allows the web panel to load all the necessary resources.

Overall, the `NodePanelRoute` class provides a simple and concise way to define the web panel route for the Ergo node. This route can be used by the Ergo node to serve the web panel to users who want to interact with the node's functionality. Here is an example of how the `NodePanelRoute` class can be used in the larger project:

```scala
val nodePanelRoute = NodePanelRoute()

val routes = nodePanelRoute.route ~ otherRoutes

Http().bindAndHandle(routes, "localhost", 8080)
```

In this example, the `NodePanelRoute` class is instantiated and its `route` method is added to a list of other routes. The `routes` variable is then passed to the `bindAndHandle` method of the Akka HTTP server, which starts the server and listens for incoming requests on `localhost:8080`. When a request is received that matches the `/panel` path segment, the `NodePanelRoute` class's `route` method is called and the appropriate response is returned.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodePanelRoute` class?
   - The `NodePanelRoute` class is a final case class that extends the `Directives` trait and defines a `route` that handles HTTP requests for the `panel` path.

2. What does the `getFromResource` method do?
   - The `getFromResource` method retrieves a resource from the classpath as an `HttpEntity` and returns it as the response to an HTTP request.

3. What is the difference between `getFromResource` and `getFromResourceDirectory`?
   - `getFromResource` retrieves a single resource from the classpath, while `getFromResourceDirectory` retrieves all resources in a directory from the classpath and serves them as static files.
