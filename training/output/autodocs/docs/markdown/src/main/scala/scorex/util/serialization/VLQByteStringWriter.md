The `VLQByteStringWriter` class is a part of the `scorex.util.serialization` package in the Ergo project. This class extends the `VLQWriter` class and provides an implementation for writing variable-length quantity (VLQ) encoded data to a `ByteString`. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to serialize data in a compact format that can be efficiently transmitted over a network or stored in a database. The `VLQWriter` class provides a way to encode integers using a variable number of bytes, with smaller numbers requiring fewer bytes. This allows for more efficient storage and transmission of data.

The `VLQByteStringWriter` class overrides several methods from the `VLQWriter` class to provide an implementation that writes the encoded data to a `ByteString`. The `newWriter` method creates a new instance of the `VLQByteStringWriter` class. The `length` method returns the length of the `ByteString` that has been written so far. The `putChunk` method appends a `ByteString` to the end of the current `ByteString`. The `put` method writes a single byte to the `ByteString`. The `putBoolean` method writes a boolean value as a single byte to the `ByteString`. The `putBytes` methods write an array of bytes to the `ByteString`.

The `result` method returns the final `ByteString` that has been written. The `toBytes` method returns the final `ByteString` as an array of bytes.

This class can be used in the larger Ergo project to serialize data for transmission over the network or storage in a database. For example, it could be used to serialize transaction data before sending it to other nodes in the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall ergo project?
- This code defines a class called `VLQByteStringWriter` that extends `VLQWriter` and provides methods for writing variable-length quantity (VLQ) encoded data to a `ByteString`. It is likely used for serialization and deserialization of data in the ergo project.

2. What is the `VLQWriter` class and what methods does it provide?
- The `VLQWriter` class is not defined in this code snippet, but it is extended by `VLQByteStringWriter`. It likely provides methods for writing and reading data in variable-length quantity (VLQ) format.

3. What is the purpose of the `@inline` annotation on some of the methods?
- The `@inline` annotation is used to suggest to the compiler that the method should be inlined at the call site, which can improve performance by reducing method call overhead.
