The `ScorexEncoder` class is a utility class that provides methods for encoding and decoding byte arrays using the Base16 encoding scheme. It extends the `BytesEncoder` trait and overrides its methods to use the Base16 encoding scheme. The `Alphabet` field is set to the Base16 alphabet, and the `encode` and `decode` methods are implemented using the `Base16.encode` and `Base16.decode` methods respectively.

In addition to the default `BytesEncoder` methods, the `ScorexEncoder` class provides three additional methods for encoding `ModifierId` and `VersionTag` objects. These methods are intended to be used if the encoding of these objects is different from the default byte encoding used by the `BytesEncoder` methods. The `encode` method takes a `String` input and returns the same `String` as output. The `encodeVersion` method takes a `VersionTag` object and returns its encoded form as a `String`. The `encodeId` method takes a `ModifierId` object and returns its encoded form as a `String`.

The `ScorexEncoder` class can be used in the larger project to encode and decode byte arrays using the Base16 encoding scheme. It can also be used to encode `ModifierId` and `VersionTag` objects if their encoding is different from the default byte encoding. The `default` object provides a default instance of the `ScorexEncoder` class that can be used throughout the project. 

Example usage:

```
val encoder = ScorexEncoder.default
val bytes = Array[Byte](1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val encoded = encoder.encode(bytes) // "0102030405"
val decoded = encoder.decode(encoded).get // Array[Byte](1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val version = VersionTag @@ bytes
val encodedVersion = encoder.encodeVersion(version) // "0102030405"
val id = ModifierId @@ bytes
val encodedId = encoder.encodeId(id) // "0102030405"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScorexEncoder` class?
   
   The `ScorexEncoder` class is a byte encoder that provides methods to encode and decode byte arrays using Base16 encoding. It also includes methods to encode `ModifierId` and `VersionTag` objects.

2. Why are there additional `encode` methods for `ModifierId` and `VersionTag` objects?

   The additional `encode` methods for `ModifierId` and `VersionTag` objects might be useful if the encoding of these objects is different from the default byte encoding used by the `BytesEncoder` class. These methods can be reimplemented to provide custom encoding for these objects.

3. What is the purpose of the `default` object in the `ScorexEncoder` companion object?

   The `default` object in the `ScorexEncoder` companion object provides a default instance of the `ScorexEncoder` class that can be used throughout the project. This allows for consistent encoding and decoding of byte arrays using Base16 encoding.
