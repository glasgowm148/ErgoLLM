The code defines a trait called `ApiDirectives` that provides functionality for handling HTTP requests in the ergo project. The trait extends two other traits, `CorsHandler` and `ScorexEncoding`, which provide functionality for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and encoding data using the Scorex encoding scheme, respectively.

The `ApiDirectives` trait defines three abstract values: `settings`, `apiKeyHeaderName`, and `apiKeyHash`. The `settings` value is an instance of the `RESTApiSettings` class, which contains settings for the REST API used in the ergo project. The `apiKeyHeaderName` value is a string that represents the name of the HTTP header that contains the API key. The `apiKeyHash` value is a string that represents the hash of the API key.

The trait also defines a lazy value called `withAuth`, which is a directive that can be used to authenticate HTTP requests. The `withAuth` directive first extracts the value of the `apiKeyHeaderName` HTTP header using the `optionalHeaderValueByName` directive. If the `apiKeyHash` value is empty, the request is allowed to pass through without authentication. If the `apiKeyHeaderName` value is not present in the HTTP headers, the request is rejected with an `AuthorizationFailedRejection`. If the `apiKeyHeaderName` value is present, the API key is hashed using the Blake2b256 algorithm and encoded using the Scorex encoding scheme. If the resulting hash matches the `apiKeyHash` value, the request is allowed to pass through. Otherwise, the request is rejected with an `AuthorizationFailedRejection`.

This trait can be used in the larger ergo project to provide authentication functionality for HTTP requests. For example, a route in the ergo project that requires authentication can use the `withAuth` directive to ensure that only authorized requests are allowed to access the route. Here is an example of how the `withAuth` directive can be used in a route:

```
val myRoute = path("myRoute") {
  withAuth {
    complete("Authenticated!")
  }
}
```

In this example, the `myRoute` route requires authentication using the `withAuth` directive. If the request is authenticated, the route returns a response with the message "Authenticated!". If the request is not authenticated, the `AuthorizationFailedRejection` is returned.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a trait called `ApiDirectives` that provides a directive for authenticating API requests using an API key.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
- This code file depends on the Akka HTTP and Scorex libraries.

3. How does the authentication process work in this code file?
- The `withAuth` directive checks if the API key header is present in the request and if it matches the hashed API key stored in the `RESTApiSettings` object. If the key is missing or does not match, the directive rejects the request with an `AuthorizationFailedRejection`.
