The `CacheSettings` class and its nested case classes `HistoryCacheSettings`, `NetworkCacheSettings`, and `MempoolCacheSettings` define the configuration settings for different caches used in the Ergo platform. 

The `CacheSettings` class contains instances of the other three case classes, each of which specifies the cache size and expiration time for a specific type of cache. The `HistoryCacheSettings` case class defines the cache size for different sections of the blockchain history, while the `NetworkCacheSettings` and `MempoolCacheSettings` case classes define the cache size and expiration time for invalid modifiers in the network and mempool caches, respectively.

These cache settings are used throughout the Ergo platform to optimize performance and reduce the need for repeated computations. For example, the history cache may be used to store frequently accessed sections of the blockchain history, reducing the need to recompute them each time they are needed. Similarly, the network and mempool caches may be used to store invalid modifiers that have been previously seen, reducing the need to revalidate them each time they are encountered.

Developers working on the Ergo platform may need to modify these cache settings to optimize performance for their specific use case. They can do so by modifying the configuration file located at `src/main/resources/application.conf`, which contains descriptions of each of the cache settings and their default values.

Example usage:

```scala
val cacheSettings = CacheSettings(
  HistoryCacheSettings(100, 50, 200, 500),
  NetworkCacheSettings(1000, FiniteDuration(1, "hour")),
  MempoolCacheSettings(500, FiniteDuration(30, "minutes"))
)
```

This creates a new instance of `CacheSettings` with the following cache settings:
- `HistoryCacheSettings`: block sections cache size of 100, extra cache size of 50, headers cache size of 200, and indexes cache size of 500
- `NetworkCacheSettings`: invalid modifiers cache size of 1000 and expiration time of 1 hour
- `MempoolCacheSettings`: invalid modifiers cache size of 500 and expiration time of 30 minutes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines case classes for cache settings related to history, network, and mempool for a project called ergo.

2. What are the parameters for each cache setting?
   - The `HistoryCacheSettings` case class has parameters for blockSectionsCacheSize, extraCacheSize, headersCacheSize, and indexesCacheSize. The `NetworkCacheSettings` and `MempoolCacheSettings` case classes both have parameters for invalidModifiersCacheSize and invalidModifiersCacheExpiration.

3. Where can the parameters for these cache settings be found?
   - The parameters for these cache settings can be found in the `application.conf` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
