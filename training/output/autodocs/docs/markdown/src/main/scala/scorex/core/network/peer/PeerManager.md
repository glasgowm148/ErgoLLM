The `PeerManager` class is responsible for managing peers connected to the network. It is a singleton class that handles the addition, removal, and blacklisting of peers. The class also chooses a random peer to connect to. 

The `PeerManager` class receives messages from other actors in the system. The `peersManagement` method handles messages related to peer management, such as adding or removing peers, confirming connections, and penalizing peers. The `apiInterface` method handles messages related to the API, such as getting all peers or getting blacklisted peers. 

The `PeerManager` class uses a `PeerDatabase` object to store information about known peers. If the database is empty, the class fills it with peers from the configuration file. The class also checks if a peer is the same as the current node by comparing IP addresses. 

The `PeerManager` class has several nested classes and objects that define the messages it can receive. These messages include `ConfirmConnection`, `ConnectionConfirmed`, `ConnectionDenied`, `Penalize`, `AddOrUpdatePeer`, `AddPeerIfEmpty`, `RemovePeer`, `GetAllPeers`, `GetBlacklistedPeers`, `SeenPeers`, `RandomPeerExcluding`, and `Blacklisted`. 

The `SeenPeers` message is used to choose a random set of peers to recommend to a peer asking for more peers. The `RandomPeerExcluding` message is used to choose a random peer to connect to, excluding a set of excluded peers. 

Overall, the `PeerManager` class is an important component of the `ergo` project, as it manages the peers connected to the network and facilitates communication between nodes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerManager` class?
- The `PeerManager` class manages connected peers and chooses a random peer to connect to.

2. What is the `isSelf` method used for?
- The `isSelf` method is used to determine if a given peer's address is the same as the address of the current node.

3. What is the purpose of the `RandomPeerExcluding` case class?
- The `RandomPeerExcluding` case class is used to choose a random peer to connect to, excluding a list of specified peers.
