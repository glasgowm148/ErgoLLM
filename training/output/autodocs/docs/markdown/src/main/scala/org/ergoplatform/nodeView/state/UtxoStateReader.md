The `UtxoStateReader` trait is used to define a reader for the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) state of the Ergo blockchain. It extends the `ErgoStateReader` trait and the `TransactionValidation` trait. The former provides methods to read the current state of the blockchain, while the latter provides methods to validate transactions. 

The `UtxoStateReader` trait defines several methods to interact with the UTXO state. The `generateBatchProofForBoxes` method takes a sequence of box IDs and generates a proof for the corresponding boxes. The `validateWithCost` method validates a transaction against the current state context, or the state context from the previous block if not specified. The `extractEmissionBox` method extracts the emission box from a given block. The `boxById` method retrieves a box from the UTXO set by its ID. The `proofsForTransactions` method generates proofs for a sequence of transactions. The `withUnconfirmedTransactions` and `withTransactions` methods produce a copy of the state that takes into account the outputs of given transactions. The `withMempool` method produces a copy of the state that takes into account the pool of unconfirmed transactions.

The `UtxoStateReader` trait uses several other classes and traits. The `ErgoBox` class represents a box in the UTXO set. The `EmissionRules` class defines the emission rules for the Ergo blockchain. The `ErgoFullBlock` class represents a full block in the Ergo blockchain. The `ErgoTransaction` class represents a transaction in the Ergo blockchain. The `UnconfirmedTransaction` class represents an unconfirmed transaction in the Ergo blockchain. The `ErgoMemPoolReader` trait defines a reader for the mempool of the Ergo blockchain. The `StateConstants` trait defines constants used in the UTXO state. The `PersistentBatchAVLProver` class is used to maintain the UTXO set. The `VersionedLDBAVLStorage` class is used to store the UTXO set. The `ADKey` class represents a key in an authenticated data structure. The `SerializedAdProof` class represents a serialized proof in an authenticated data structure. The `Digest32` class represents a 32-byte digest. The `MalformedModifierError` class represents an error that occurs when a modifier is malformed. The `Algos` object provides hash functions used in the Ergo blockchain. The `ErgoInterpreter` class is used to interpret ErgoScript code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UtxoStateReader` trait?
- The `UtxoStateReader` trait is used to read the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) state of the Ergo blockchain and validate transactions against it.

2. What is the `generateBatchProofForBoxes` method used for?
- The `generateBatchProofForBoxes` method is used to generate a serialized proof for a batch of Ergo boxes.

3. What is the purpose of the `emissionBoxOpt` method?
- The `emissionBoxOpt` method is used to retrieve the emission box from the UTXO state, which is used to reward miners for adding new blocks to the blockchain.
