The `ExtensionCandidate` class is a section of an extension block that holds key-value data. It is useful when a header is not formed yet. The class takes a sequence of key-value pairs as input, where keys must be of 2 bytes length, unique, and values must be no more than 64 bytes long. The data must be 32,768 bytes max. 

The class has several methods that allow for the manipulation of the data. The `merkleTree` method creates a Merkle tree from the key-value pairs. The `digest` method returns the root hash of the Merkle tree. The `interlinksMerkleTree` method creates a Merkle tree from the key-value pairs that have a key starting with the `InterlinksVectorPrefix`. The `interlinksDigest` method returns the root hash of the interlinks Merkle tree. 

The `toExtension` method creates an `Extension` object from the `ExtensionCandidate` object and a header ID. The `++` method concatenates two `ExtensionCandidate` objects. The `proofFor` method returns a Merkle proof for a given key. The `batchProofFor` method constructs a `BatchMerkleProof` for a list of interlinks. 

The `ExtensionCandidate` object has an `apply` method that creates a new `ExtensionCandidate` object from a sequence of key-value pairs. 

Overall, the `ExtensionCandidate` class provides a way to store and manipulate key-value data in an extension block. It allows for the creation of Merkle trees and proofs, as well as concatenation of multiple `ExtensionCandidate` objects. This class is likely used in the larger project to handle extension blocks and their associated data. 

Example usage:

```
val fields = Seq((Array[Byte](0, 1), Array[Byte](1, 2, 3)), (Array[Byte](0, 2), Array[Byte](4, 5, 6)))
val extCandidate = ExtensionCandidate(fields)
val merkleTree = extCandidate.merkleTree
val digest = extCandidate.digest
val interlinksMerkleTree = extCandidate.interlinksMerkleTree
val interlinksDigest = extCandidate.interlinksDigest
val ext = extCandidate.toExtension(ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1: Byte))
val newFields = Seq((Array[Byte](0, 3), Array[Byte](7, 8, 9)))
val newExtCandidate = ExtensionCandidate(newFields)
val concatenated = extCandidate ++ newExtCandidate
val proof = extCandidate.proofFor(Array[Byte](0, 1))
val batchProof = extCandidate.batchProofFor(Array[Byte](1, 2), Array[Byte](2, 3))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExtensionCandidate` class?
- The `ExtensionCandidate` class represents an extension block section without a header ID, which is useful when a header is not formed yet.

2. What is the `++` method used for in the `ExtensionCandidate` class?
- The `++` method is used to concatenate two `ExtensionCandidate` objects together.

3. What is the `batchProofFor` method used for in the `ExtensionCandidate` class?
- The `batchProofFor` method constructs a `BatchMerkleProof` for a list of interlinks, but only accounts for interlink vector fields in the extension.
