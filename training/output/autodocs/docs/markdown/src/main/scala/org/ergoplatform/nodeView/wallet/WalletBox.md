The `WalletBox` class in the `org.ergoplatform.nodeView.wallet` package is a data class that represents a tracked box in a wallet. It contains a `TrackedBox` object and an optional `confirmationsNumOpt` integer value that represents the number of confirmations for the transaction that created the box. 

The `WalletBox` object also includes an `encoder` method that converts a `WalletBox` object to a JSON object. This method uses the `io.circe` library to encode the `TrackedBox` object as a JSON object and adds the `confirmationsNum` and `address` fields to the resulting JSON object. The `confirmationsNum` field is set to the value of the `confirmationsNumOpt` field, and the `address` field is set to the Ergo address of the box.

The `WalletBox` object also includes an `apply` method that creates a new `WalletBox` object from a `TrackedBox` object and the current height of the blockchain. This method calculates the number of confirmations for the transaction that created the box by subtracting the inclusion height of the box from the current height of the blockchain.

This code is likely used in the larger project to represent tracked boxes in a wallet and to encode them as JSON objects for use in the project's API. The `WalletBox` object can be used to store information about a box in a wallet, such as its Ergo address and the number of confirmations for the transaction that created it. The `encoder` method can be used to convert a `WalletBox` object to a JSON object for use in the project's API responses. The `apply` method can be used to create a new `WalletBox` object from a `TrackedBox` object and the current height of the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WalletBox` class and how is it related to the `TrackedBox` class?
- The `WalletBox` class is a wrapper around a `TrackedBox` instance that includes additional information such as the number of confirmations and the address associated with the box. 

2. What is the purpose of the `encoder` method and how is it used?
- The `encoder` method is used to convert a `WalletBox` instance into a JSON object that includes the information about the associated `TrackedBox`, number of confirmations, and address. It is used to serialize `WalletBox` instances for use in API responses. 

3. What is the significance of the `detalization` implicit value and how is it used?
- The `detalization` implicit value is used to specify the level of detail to include in the JSON output of the `encoder` method. In this case, it is set to `ShowDetails`, which means that all available information about the `WalletBox` instance will be included in the JSON output.
