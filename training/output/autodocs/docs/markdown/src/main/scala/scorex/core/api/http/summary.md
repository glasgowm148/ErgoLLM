The `.autodoc/docs/json/src/main/scala/scorex/core/api/http` folder contains various Scala files that provide functionality for handling HTTP requests, responses, and errors in the Ergo project. These files define traits, classes, and objects that can be used to build HTTP API routes, handle CORS, authenticate requests, and serve Swagger documentation.

For example, the `ApiDirectives.scala` file defines a trait called `ApiDirectives` that provides functionality for handling HTTP requests, including authentication. A route in the Ergo project that requires authentication can use the `withAuth` directive to ensure that only authorized requests are allowed to access the route:

```scala
val myRoute = path("myRoute") {
  withAuth {
    complete("Authenticated!")
  }
}
```

The `ApiError.scala` file provides a simple and flexible way to handle HTTP errors in the Ergo project's API. It can be used to catch exceptions and return appropriate error messages:

```scala
val route: Route = path("example") {
  get {
    try {
      // ...
    } catch {
      case e: Exception => ApiError.InternalError(e)
    }
  }
}
```

The `CompositeHttpService.scala` class can be used to combine multiple routes into a single route and serve them as a composite HTTP service. This is useful for providing a unified API for various components of the system:

```scala
val compositeHttpService = new CompositeHttpService(actorSystem, apiRoutes, restApiSettings, swaggerConf)
val combinedRoute = compositeHttpService.compositeRoute
```

The `CorsHandler.scala` trait provides tools for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) spec workflow, allowing developers to easily handle CORS requests and responses in an Akka HTTP server:

```scala
val myRoute: Route = path("myPath") {
  // route logic here
}

val corsRoute: Route = corsHandler(myRoute)
```

The `swagger` subfolder contains the `SwaggerConfigRoute.scala` file, which is responsible for providing a route to serve the Swagger configuration file. This enables developers to access the Swagger documentation for the API and test the endpoints:

```scala
val swaggerConf = "{ \"swagger\": \"2.0\", ... }"
val settings = RESTApiSettings()
val swaggerRoute = new SwaggerConfigRoute(swaggerConf, settings)

val routes = swaggerRoute.route
```

Overall, the code in this folder plays a crucial role in building and managing the HTTP API for the Ergo project. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that make it easier for developers to create, test, and debug API endpoints, handle errors, and ensure a smooth user experience.
