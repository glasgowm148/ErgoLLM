The `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` class in the `org.ergoplatform.mining` package is used to provide proof of inclusion of certain transactions into a block with a known but yet unproven header. This class is particularly useful for collateralized pools, as it allows miners to show that a transaction is included in an upcoming block that they are working on. 

The class takes two parameters: `minHeader`, which is an unproven or proven header, and `txProofs`, which are proofs of membership for transactions against a transactions Merkle tree digest in the header. The `check()` method checks that all the proofs of membership are valid and returns `true` if all the transactions are valid, and `false` otherwise.

The `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` object contains an implicit `encoder` that encodes a `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` instance into a JSON object. The `encoder` takes a `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` instance and converts it into a JSON object with two fields: `msgPreimage` and `txProofs`. The `msgPreimage` field is the encoded bytes of the `minHeader` parameter, while the `txProofs` field is the `txProofs` parameter encoded as a JSON array.

This class is likely used in the larger project to facilitate the mining process. By providing proof of inclusion of certain transactions into a block, miners can ensure that their transactions are included in the upcoming block they are working on. This can be particularly useful for collateralized pools, where miners need to show that a transaction is included in a block to receive payment. 

Example usage:

```scala
import org.ergoplatform.nodeView.mempool.TransactionMembershipProof
import org.ergoplatform.modifiers.history.header.HeaderWithoutPow

// create a header without proof
val headerWithoutProof = HeaderWithoutPow()

// create a transaction membership proof
val txProof = TransactionMembershipProof(Seq.empty)

// create a proof of upcoming transactions
val proof = ProofOfUpcomingTransactions(headerWithoutProof, Seq(txProof))

// check that all the proofs of membership are valid
val isValid = proof.check()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` class?
   
   The `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` class is used to provide proof of inclusion of certain transactions into a block with known and yet unproven header, which can be useful for collateralized pools and other scenarios where a miner needs to show that a transaction is included into upcoming block the miner is working on.

2. What is the `check()` method used for?
   
   The `check()` method is used to check that all the proofs of membership are valid, and returns true if all the transactions are valid, false otherwise.

3. What is the purpose of the `encoder` object in the `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` companion object?
   
   The `encoder` object in the `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` companion object is used to define an implicit `Encoder` for the `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` class, which encodes an instance of the class as a JSON object with a `msgPreimage` field and a `txProofs` field.
