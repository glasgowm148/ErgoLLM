The `scorex.core.utils` package provides utility functions and classes for the Ergo project, which can be used to simplify interactions with Akka actors, work with network addresses, and encode/decode byte arrays using the Base16 encoding scheme.

`ActorHelper.scala` defines a trait called `ActorHelper` that provides a helper method for interacting with Akka actors. The `askActor` method encapsulates the ask pattern for actors and returns a `Future` of the specified type `A`. This trait can be used to simplify interactions with Akka actors in the larger project. For example:

```scala
class UserAuthenticator(authActor: ActorRef) extends ActorHelper {
  implicit val timeout: Timeout = Timeout(5.seconds)

  def authenticate(username: String, password: String): Future[Boolean] = {
    val authRequest = AuthRequest(username, password)
    askActor[Boolean](authActor, authRequest)
  }
}
```

`NetworkUtils.scala` provides two methods for working with network addresses: `getListenAddresses` and `isSelf`. These methods are likely used in the larger project to facilitate communication between nodes in a distributed system. For example, the `getListenAddresses` method may be used to bind a socket to all the local node's addresses, while the `isSelf` method may be used to filter out messages that are sent to the local node itself.

`ScorexEncoder.scala` is a utility class that provides methods for encoding and decoding byte arrays using the Base16 encoding scheme. It can also be used to encode `ModifierId` and `VersionTag` objects if their encoding is different from the default byte encoding. Example usage:

```scala
val encoder = ScorexEncoder.default
val bytes = Array[Byte](1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val encoded = encoder.encode(bytes) // "0102030405"
```

`ScorexEncoding.scala` defines a trait called `ScorexEncoding` that provides an implicit `ScorexEncoder` object. This trait is likely used throughout the Ergo project to encode data for storage or transmission. To use this trait, a class or object would need to extend it and then use the `encoder` object to encode bytes into strings.

`utils.scala` contains a set of utility functions that can be used across the Ergo project, such as `profile`, `toTry`, `untilTimeout`, `randomBytes`, `concatBytes`, and `concatFixLengthBytes`. These functions can be used for various purposes, such as profiling the performance of different parts of the codebase, converting boolean expressions into `Try` objects, and generating random data for cryptographic purposes. The `MapPimp` class adds two methods to mutable maps, `adjust` and `flatAdjust`, which can be used to update mutable maps in a concise and readable way.
