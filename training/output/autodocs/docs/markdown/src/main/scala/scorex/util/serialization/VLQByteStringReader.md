The `VLQByteStringReader` class is a part of the `scorex.util.serialization` package and is used for reading variable-length quantity (VLQ) encoded data from a `ByteString`. The class extends the `VLQReader` trait, which defines the methods for reading VLQ-encoded data. 

The `VLQByteStringReader` class has a constructor that takes a `ByteString` as a parameter. The `ByteString` is used to initialize the `it` variable, which is an iterator over the bytes in the `ByteString`. The class also has two private variables `_position` and `_mark`, which are used to keep track of the current position and a marked position in the `ByteString`.

The class implements the methods defined in the `VLQReader` trait. These methods include `getByte()`, `getBytes(size: Int)`, `getChunk(size: Int)`, `peekByte()`, `mark()`, `consumed`, `position`, and `remaining`. 

The `getByte()` method reads a single byte from the `ByteString` and advances the position by one. The `getBytes(size: Int)` method reads a specified number of bytes from the `ByteString` and advances the position by the number of bytes read. The `getChunk(size: Int)` method reads a specified number of bytes from the `ByteString` and returns them as a new `ByteString`. The `peekByte()` method returns the byte at the current position without advancing the position. 

The `mark()` method sets the `_mark` variable to the current position. The `consumed` method returns the number of bytes consumed since the last call to `mark()`. The `position` method returns the current position in the `ByteString`. The `position_=` method sets the current position to a specified value and updates the `it` variable accordingly. The `remaining` method returns the number of bytes remaining in the `ByteString`.

The `VLQByteStringReader` class can be used in the larger project to read VLQ-encoded data from a `ByteString`. For example, the following code creates a new `VLQByteStringReader` object and reads a VLQ-encoded integer from a `ByteString`:

```
import akka.util.ByteString
import scorex.util.serialization.VLQByteStringReader

val byteString = ByteString(0x8E, 0x8D, 0x02)
val reader = new VLQByteStringReader(byteString)
val value = reader.getVLQInt()
println(value) // Output: 1000000
```

In this example, the `ByteString` contains a VLQ-encoded integer with the value of 1000000. The `VLQByteStringReader` object is created with the `ByteString` as a parameter. The `getVLQInt()` method is then called on the `VLQByteStringReader` object to read the integer value. The value is printed to the console, which outputs `1000000`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   
   This code defines a class called `VLQByteStringReader` that extends `VLQReader` and provides methods for reading variable-length quantity (VLQ) encoded data from a `ByteString`. It solves the problem of efficiently reading and parsing VLQ-encoded data from a `ByteString` in an Akka-based application.

2. What is the difference between `getByte()` and `peekByte()` methods?
   
   The `getByte()` method reads a byte from the current position of the `ByteString` iterator and advances the position by one, while the `peekByte()` method returns the byte at the current position without advancing the position.

3. What is the purpose of the `mark()` method and how is it used?
   
   The `mark()` method sets the current position as a "mark" that can be later used to calculate the number of bytes consumed since the mark was set. It is used to keep track of the number of bytes read during a particular operation, such as parsing a message or decoding a transaction.
