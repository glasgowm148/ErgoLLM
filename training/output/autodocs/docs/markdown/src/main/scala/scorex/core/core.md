The `core` package in the `ergo` project contains a set of utility functions and objects that are used throughout the project. This file defines a set of functions and a tagged type that are used to encode and decode various types of data used in the project.

The `VersionTag` object is a tagged type that is used to represent a version tag for a modifier in the project. The `VersionTag` type is defined as a subtype of `String`, which allows it to be used in place of a regular string but with additional type safety. The `VersionTag` object is used in several of the functions defined in this file.

The `idsToString` function is used to convert a sequence of modifier IDs and their corresponding network object types to a string representation. The function takes a sequence of tuples, where each tuple contains a network object type and a modifier ID. The function then encodes each modifier ID using the `ScorexEncoder` and concatenates the resulting strings into a single string. The resulting string is enclosed in square brackets and separated by ellipses if there are more than two modifier IDs.

The `bytesToId` and `idToBytes` functions are used to convert between byte arrays and modifier IDs. The `bytesToId` function takes a byte array and returns a modifier ID, while the `idToBytes` function takes a modifier ID and returns a byte array.

The `bytesToVersion`, `versionToBytes`, `versionToId`, and `idToVersion` functions are used to convert between byte arrays and `VersionTag` objects. The `bytesToVersion` function takes a byte array and returns a `VersionTag` object, while the `versionToBytes` function takes a `VersionTag` object and returns a byte array. The `versionToId` function takes a `VersionTag` object and returns a modifier ID, while the `idToVersion` function takes a modifier ID and returns a `VersionTag` object.

Overall, this file provides a set of utility functions and objects that are used throughout the `ergo` project to encode and decode various types of data. These functions are used to convert between different representations of data, such as byte arrays and modifier IDs, and to create string representations of modifier IDs and their corresponding network object types.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `idsToString` method and how is it used?
   - The `idsToString` method takes in a sequence of modifier IDs and returns a string representation of them. It can be used to convert modifier IDs to a human-readable format for debugging or logging purposes.
2. What is the `VersionTag` object and how is it used?
   - The `VersionTag` object is a tagged type that represents a version tag as a string. It is used to provide a type-safe way of working with version tags throughout the codebase.
3. What is the purpose of the `bytesToId` and `idToBytes` methods?
   - The `bytesToId` method takes in an array of bytes and returns a modifier ID, while the `idToBytes` method takes in a modifier ID and returns an array of bytes. These methods can be used to convert modifier IDs to and from byte arrays, which is useful for serialization and deserialization.
