The `PeerSpec` class and its corresponding `PeerSpecSerializer` object are part of the `ergo` project and are used to declare information about a peer in the network. The `PeerSpec` class contains information about the peer's agent name, protocol version, node name, declared address, and features. The `agentName` field contains the name of the network agent and may contain information about the client code stack, starting from the core code-base up to the end graphical interface. The `protocolVersion` field identifies the protocol version being used by the node. The `nodeName` field contains a custom node name. The `declaredAddress` field contains the public network address of the node if any. The `features` field contains a set of node capabilities.

The `PeerSpec` class also contains two lazy values: `localAddressOpt` and `publicUrlOpt`. The `localAddressOpt` value is an option that contains the local network address of the node if any. The `publicUrlOpt` value is an option that contains the REST API URL of the node if any.

The `PeerSpecSerializer` object is used to serialize and deserialize `PeerSpec` objects. The `serialize` method serializes a `PeerSpec` object to a byte array. The `parse` method deserializes a byte array to a `PeerSpec` object.

The `PeerSpecSerializer` object uses the `ApplicationVersionSerializer` object to serialize and deserialize the `protocolVersion` field. The `PeerSpecSerializer` object also uses the `PeerFeatureDescriptors` object to serialize and deserialize the `features` field. The `PeerFeatureDescriptors` object contains a map of feature IDs to feature serializers.

Overall, the `PeerSpec` class and `PeerSpecSerializer` object are used to declare information about a peer in the network and serialize and deserialize this information. This information is used by other parts of the `ergo` project to communicate with other nodes in the network. For example, the `PeerManager` class uses `PeerSpec` objects to manage the set of connected peers in the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PeerSpec` class?
- The `PeerSpec` class is used to store information about a peer, including its agent name, protocol version, node name, declared address, and features.

2. What is the purpose of the `PeerSpecSerializer` object?
- The `PeerSpecSerializer` object is used to serialize and deserialize `PeerSpec` objects, allowing them to be transmitted over the network.

3. What are the `LocalAddressPeerFeature` and `RestApiUrlPeerFeature` classes used for?
- The `LocalAddressPeerFeature` and `RestApiUrlPeerFeature` classes are used to represent features that a peer may have, such as a local address or a REST API URL. These features are stored as part of the `PeerSpec` object.
