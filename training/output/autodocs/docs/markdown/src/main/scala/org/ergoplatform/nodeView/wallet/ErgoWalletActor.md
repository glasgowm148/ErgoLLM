The `ErgoWalletActor` is responsible for managing the wallet's state and processing various wallet-related commands. It handles wallet initialization, restoration, locking, unlocking, and closing. It also manages wallet transactions, public keys, balances, and scans.

The actor starts by initializing the wallet state and subscribing to `ChangedState` and `ChangedMempool` events. It then processes various wallet-related commands, such as `InitWallet`, `RestoreWallet`, `UnlockWallet`, `LockWallet`, `CloseWallet`, and `RescanWallet`. It also handles wallet state updates, such as `ChangedState` and `ChangedMempool`, and manages wallet scans with commands like `AddScan`, `RemoveScan`, and `StopTracking`.

For transaction-related operations, the actor provides commands like `GenerateTransaction`, `SignTransaction`, `ExtractHints`, and `GetTransactions`. It also supports reading wallet balances, public keys, and wallet boxes with commands like `ReadBalances`, `ReadPublicKeys`, and `GetWalletBoxes`.

Here's an example of how to use the `ErgoWalletActor` to generate a transaction:

```scala
walletActor ! GenerateTransaction(requests, inputsRaw, dataInputsRaw, sign)
```

The actor also supports managing scans, which are used to track specific wallet-related events. You can add, remove, and update scans using commands like `AddScan`, `RemoveScan`, and `UpdateChangeAddress`.

In summary, the `ErgoWalletActor` is a crucial component in the Ergo project, responsible for managing the wallet's state and processing various wallet-related commands. It provides a comprehensive set of commands and operations for managing wallet transactions, public keys, balances, and scans.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `ErgoWalletActor` class?**

   The `ErgoWalletActor` class is responsible for managing the wallet's state and processing various wallet-related commands, such as generating transactions, scanning blocks, managing keys, and updating the wallet's state based on changes in the blockchain.

2. **How does the wallet handle errors and exceptions?**

   The wallet uses a supervisor strategy with a `OneForOneStrategy` that handles different types of exceptions by either stopping or restarting the actor. It also logs the error messages and, in some cases, updates the wallet state with the error message.

3. **How does the wallet handle unlocking and locking?**

   The wallet provides `UnlockWallet` and `LockWallet` case classes for unlocking and locking the wallet, respectively. When unlocking the wallet, it calls the `ergoWalletService.unlockWallet` method with the provided wallet password. When locking the wallet, it calls the `ergoWalletService.lockWallet` method. The wallet's state is updated accordingly in both cases.
