The `ErgoWalletService` is a core component of the Ergo project that provides various wallet-related operations. It is responsible for managing the wallet's state, including reading and writing encrypted wallet files, initializing and restoring wallets, and unlocking and locking wallets. Additionally, it provides methods for managing wallet transactions, such as generating, signing, and extracting transaction hints.

The `ErgoWalletService` also offers methods for managing wallet boxes, including collecting boxes according to a given request, deriving keys from a given path, and deriving the next key from the master key. It also provides methods for managing scans, such as adding and removing scans, and updating the UTXO state.

For example, to initialize a new wallet, the `initWallet` method is used, which takes the current wallet state, settings, wallet password, and optional mnemonic password as arguments. It generates a new mnemonic and initializes the wallet's secret storage with the encrypted wallet file.

To sign a transaction, the `signTransaction` method is used, which takes the prover, unsigned transaction, secrets, hints, boxes to spend, data boxes, parameters, and state context as arguments. It signs the transaction using the provided secrets and returns the signed transaction.

In summary, the `ErgoWalletService` is a crucial component in the Ergo project that handles various wallet-related operations, such as managing wallet state, transactions, and keys. It is used by the `ErgoWalletActor` to perform these operations and maintain the wallet's overall functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ErgoWalletService` trait and how does it interact with the `ErgoWalletActor`?
   **Answer**: The `ErgoWalletService` trait defines a set of operations that can be performed on the Ergo wallet, such as reading, initializing, unlocking, and locking the wallet, as well as generating and signing transactions. These operations are accessible from the `ErgoWalletActor`, which is responsible for managing the wallet's state and handling incoming requests.

2. **Question**: How does the `readWallet` function work and what is the purpose of the `testMnemonic` parameter?
   **Answer**: The `readWallet` function is responsible for reading the wallet's state from an encrypted JSON file or bypassing the secret storage reading by providing a mnemonic directly (for test mode only). The `testMnemonic` parameter is an optional `SecretString` that, when provided, allows the wallet to be initialized in test mode, bypassing the need to read the encrypted wallet file.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `generateCommitments` function and how does it relate to EIP-11?
   **Answer**: The `generateCommitments` function is responsible for generating commitments that can be used later to sign a transaction. It is related to EIP-11 (Ergo Improvement Proposal 11), which describes a protocol for distributed transaction signing. The function takes an unsigned transaction, optional external secrets, and optional external input and data input boxes, and generates a `TransactionHintsBag` containing the necessary commitments for signing the transaction.
