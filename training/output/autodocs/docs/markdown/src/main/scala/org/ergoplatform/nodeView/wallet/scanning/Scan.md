This code defines classes and methods related to scanning the Ergo blockchain for specific boxes. The `Scan` class wraps information about a user scan, which provides scanning rules for specific boxes and works with boxes found by the node. It contains a unique identifier for the scan, a description of the scan, a predicate to scan the blockchain for specific scan-related boxes, a flag that prescribes how the scan interacts with the p2pk-wallet, and a flag that prescribes whether box spent offchain should be removed from unspent boxes. 

The `ScanRequest` class encodes an API request to create a scan. It contains a scan description, a predicate to scan the blockchain for specific scan-related boxes, a flag that prescribes how the scan interacts with the p2pk-wallet, and a flag that prescribes whether box spent offchain should be removed from unspent boxes. 

The `ScanSerializer` object defines methods for serializing and parsing `Scan` objects. The `ScanJsonCodecs` object defines JSON codecs for `Scan` and `ScanRequest` objects. 

This code is used in the larger Ergo project to enable users to scan the blockchain for specific boxes and interact with the p2pk-wallet. For example, a user could create a scan to search for boxes that contain a specific token or have a certain value. The `Scan` object would contain the rules for this search, and the `ScanRequest` object would encode an API request to create the scan. The `ScanSerializer` object would handle serialization and parsing of `Scan` objects, and the `ScanJsonCodecs` object would handle JSON encoding and decoding of `Scan` and `ScanRequest` objects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Scan` case class and how is it used?
- The `Scan` case class wraps information about a user scan, providing scanning rules for specific boxes and interacting with boxes found by the node. It is used to create a scan request and serialize/deserialize scan data.
2. What is the `ScanRequest` case class and how does it relate to the `Scan` case class?
- The `ScanRequest` case class encodes an API request to create a scan, and can be converted to a `Scan` case class using the `toScan` method. It contains the same fields as `Scan`, but with optional values for `walletInteraction` and `removeOffchain`.
3. What is the purpose of the `ScanSerializer` object and how is it used?
- The `ScanSerializer` object is a Scorex serializer for the `Scan` case class, used to serialize and deserialize scan data. It includes methods for serializing and parsing `Scan` objects, as well as handling backwards compatibility for previous versions of serialized scans.
