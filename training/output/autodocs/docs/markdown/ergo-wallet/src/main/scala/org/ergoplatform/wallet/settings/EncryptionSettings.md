The code defines a case class called `EncryptionSettings` that represents the encryption parameters used in the project. The class has three parameters: `prf`, `c`, and `dkLen`. `prf` is a string that represents the pseudo-random function with output of length `dkLen` (PBKDF2 param). `c` is the number of PBKDF2 iterations, and `dkLen` is the desired bit-length of the derived key.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to encode and decode `EncryptionSettings` objects to and from JSON format using the `io.circe` library. The `EncryptionSettingsEncoder` object provides an implementation of the `Encoder` trait for `EncryptionSettings` objects, which allows them to be converted to JSON. The `EncryptionSettingsDecoder` object provides an implementation of the `Decoder` trait for `EncryptionSettings` objects, which allows them to be created from JSON.

This code is likely used in the larger project to store and retrieve encryption settings in a persistent format, such as a file or a database. For example, the project may have a configuration file that contains the encryption settings, and this code would be used to read and write those settings to and from the file.

Here is an example of how this code might be used to encode an `EncryptionSettings` object to JSON:

```
import org.ergoplatform.wallet.settings.EncryptionSettings
import io.circe.syntax._

val settings = EncryptionSettings("AES-256", 10000, 256)
val json = settings.asJson
```

This would create a JSON object that looks like this:

```
{
  "prf" : "AES-256",
  "c" : 10000,
  "dkLen" : 256
}
```

And here is an example of how the JSON object could be decoded back into an `EncryptionSettings` object:

```
import org.ergoplatform.wallet.settings.EncryptionSettings
import io.circe.parser._

val jsonString = """{"prf":"AES-256","c":10000,"dkLen":256}"""
val json = parse(jsonString).getOrElse(throw new Exception("Invalid JSON"))
val settings = json.as[EncryptionSettings].getOrElse(throw new Exception("Invalid EncryptionSettings"))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EncryptionSettings` class?
   - The `EncryptionSettings` class defines the encryption parameters for the project.

2. What is the purpose of the `EncryptionSettingsEncoder` and `EncryptionSettingsDecoder` objects?
   - The `EncryptionSettingsEncoder` object encodes an `EncryptionSettings` object to JSON format, while the `EncryptionSettingsDecoder` object decodes a JSON object to an `EncryptionSettings` object.

3. Why is the `cats.syntax.either._` import needed?
   - The `cats.syntax.either._` import is needed for compatibility with Scala 2.11.
