The `ReplaceCompactCollectBoxSelector` class is a box selector that is used to select boxes to spend in order to collect needed amounts of ergo tokens and assets. It is parameterized by the maximum number of inputs a transaction can have, the optimal number of inputs, and re-emission settings. 

The selector works as follows:
1. The selector first picks up boxes in a given order (1,2,3,4,...) by using the `DefaultBoxSelector`.
2. If the number of inputs exceeds the limit, the selector sorts the remaining boxes (actually, only 10*maximum boxes) by value in descending order and replaces small-value boxes in the inputs by big-value from the tail (1,2,3,4 => 10).
3. If the number of inputs still exceeds the limit, the selector tries to throw away the dust if possible. For example, if inputs are (100, 200, 1, 2, 1000), target value is 1300, and the maximum number of inputs is 3, the selector kicks out (1, 2).
4. If the number of inputs after the previous steps is below optimal, the selector tries to append the dust by sorting remaining boxes in ascending order and appending them till the optimal number of inputs.

The `select` method is used to select boxes to spend. It takes unspent boxes to choose from, a user-provided filter function for boxes, ergo balance to be met, and assets balances to be met. It returns `Left(error)` if `select()` is failing to pick appropriate boxes, otherwise `Right(res)`, where `res` contains boxes to spend as well as monetary values and assets for boxes containing change (wrapped in a special `BoxSelectionResult` class).

The `calcChange` method is used to calculate the change boxes. It takes boxes, target balance, and target assets as input and returns a sequence of `ErgoBoxAssets`.

The `collectDust` method is used to collect dust. It takes `bsr`, `tail`, `targetBalance`, and `targetAssets` as input and returns `Either[BoxSelectionError, BoxSelectionResult[T]]`.

The `compress` method is used to compress the boxes. It takes `bsr`, `targetBalance`, and `targetAssets` as input and returns `Either[BoxSelectionError, BoxSelectionResult[T]]`.

The `replace` method is used to replace the boxes. It takes `bsr`, `tail`, `targetBalance`, and `targetAssets` as input and returns `Either[BoxSelectionError, BoxSelectionResult[T]]`.

The `MaxInputsExceededError` case class is used to represent an error when the maximum number of inputs is exceeded.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it work?
- This code is a box selector for selecting boxes to spend in order to collect needed amounts of ergo tokens and assets. It is parameterized by maximum and optimal number of inputs a transaction can have. The selector first picks up boxes in given order, and if the number of inputs exceeds the limit, it sorts remaining boxes by value in descending order and replaces small-value boxes in the inputs by big-value from the tail. If the number of inputs still exceeds the limit, the selector tries to throw away the dust if possible. If the number of inputs after the previous steps is below optimal, the selector tries to append the dust, by sorting remaining boxes in ascending order and appending them till optimal number of inputs.

2. What is the purpose of the `calcChange`, `collectDust`, `compress`, and `replace` methods?
- `calcChange` calculates the change boxes needed for a given set of boxes, target balance, and target assets.
- `collectDust` collects dust boxes to append to the input boxes if the number of inputs is below optimal.
- `compress` tries to throw away the dust boxes if the number of inputs exceeds the limit.
- `replace` replaces small-value boxes in the inputs by big-value from the tail if the number of inputs exceeds the limit.

3. What is the purpose of the `MaxInputsExceededError` case class?
- The `MaxInputsExceededError` case class is used to represent an error when the number of boxes exceeds the maximum number of inputs allowed in a transaction.
