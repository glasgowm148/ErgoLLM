The `ByteArrayWrapper` class is a wrapper for a byte array that provides methods for hashing, comparison, and equality. It is used in the `scorex` project to wrap byte arrays that are used as keys in a database. 

The class is defined as a case class, which means that it has a default constructor that takes a single argument, `data`, which is the byte array to be wrapped. The class also has an alternative constructor that takes an integer `size` and creates a new empty byte array of that size. 

The `ByteArrayWrapper` class implements the `Serializable` interface, which means that it can be serialized and deserialized. It also implements the `Comparable` and `Ordered` interfaces, which means that it can be compared to other `ByteArrayWrapper` objects. 

The `equals` method of the `ByteArrayWrapper` class checks if the argument is an instance of `ByteArrayWrapper` and if the wrapped byte arrays are equal. The `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the wrapped byte array using the `ByteUtils.byteArrayHashCode` method. The `compareTo` method compares the wrapped byte array to another `ByteArrayWrapper` object using the `ByteUtils.BYTE_ARRAY_COMPARATOR` comparator. The `compare` method is implemented in terms of `compareTo`. 

The `toString` method of the `ByteArrayWrapper` class returns a string representation of the object. If the size of the wrapped byte array is 8, it is displayed as a number. Otherwise, it is displayed as a hexadecimal string using the `javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary` method. 

Overall, the `ByteArrayWrapper` class provides a convenient way to wrap byte arrays and provides methods for hashing, comparison, and equality that are useful in the context of a database. 

Example usage:

```scala
val byteArray1 = Array[Byte](1, 2, 3)
val byteArray2 = Array[Byte](1, 2, 3)
val byteArray3 = Array[Byte](4, 5, 6)

val wrapper1 = ByteArrayWrapper(byteArray1)
val wrapper2 = ByteArrayWrapper(byteArray2)
val wrapper3 = ByteArrayWrapper(byteArray3)

assert(wrapper1 == wrapper2)
assert(wrapper1.hashCode == wrapper2.hashCode)
assert(wrapper1 != wrapper3)
assert(wrapper1.compareTo(wrapper2) == 0)
assert(wrapper1.compareTo(wrapper3) < 0)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `ByteArrayWrapper` that wraps a byte array and provides methods for hashing, comparing, and ordering byte arrays.

2. Is the wrapped data immutable?
- There is a TODO comment in the code asking whether the wrapped data is immutable, but it is not clear from the code whether it is or not.

3. Why does the `toString` method display byte arrays of size 8 as numbers?
- The `toString` method checks if the size of the byte array is 8, and if so, it displays the bytes as a long integer. This is likely because byte arrays of size 8 are often used to represent long integers in various contexts.
