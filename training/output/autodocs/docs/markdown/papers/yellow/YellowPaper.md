This code is for a LaTeX document that describes the Ergo Platform, a conservative Proof-of-Work blockchain with a new contract language called ErgoTree. The document is structured into two main parts: the protocol and the reference implementation.

The protocol section covers various aspects of the Ergo Platform, such as the vision, state-oriented design, cryptographic primitives, and modes of operation. It also discusses the transaction format, validation rules, and proof-of-work. The reference implementation section provides details on the synchronization process and wallet functionality.

The document uses various LaTeX packages for formatting, such as color, graphicx, amssymb, amsthm, amsmath, and hyperref. It also defines several custom commands and environments for formatting and notation, such as newtheorem, def, and newcommand.

## Questions: 
 1. **What curve is used for the cryptographic primitives in this code?**

   The code does not explicitly mention which elliptic curve is used for the cryptographic primitives. More information might be available in other parts of the project or documentation.

2. **What is the purpose of the different modes of operation (Full-Node, Pruned Full-Node, Light Full-Node, and Light-SPV)?**

   The different modes of operation are designed to accommodate various levels of security and resource requirements for nodes participating in the Ergo network. Full-Node provides the highest security and requires the most resources, while Light-SPV is designed for low-end hardware and mobile devices with reduced security requirements.

3. **How are transaction validation rules enforced in this code?**

   Transaction validation rules are enforced through a combination of stateless and stateful checks. Stateless checks can be performed using only the transaction data, while stateful checks require knowledge of the current state, such as the UTXO set. The specific rules for transaction validation are detailed in Section~\ref{tx-validation}.
