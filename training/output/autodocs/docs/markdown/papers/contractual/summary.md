The `.autodoc/docs/json/papers/contractual` folder contains code and documentation related to the concept of "contractual money" in the context of cryptocurrencies, specifically focusing on the Ergo platform. Contractual money refers to digital money with a usage contract in the form of executable code, enabling more control over how the money is spent and ensuring that it is used according to the terms of the contract.

The `main.tex` file is a LaTeX document that discusses the transactional model of Bitcoin and Ergo, provides several use cases for contractual money, revisits the famous WÃ¶rgl experiment, and describes two possible Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) implementations on top of the Ergo blockchain. This document demonstrates the potential of contractual money in various use cases and highlights the benefits of using cryptocurrencies like Ergo to implement such systems.

The `compile.sh` file is a set of commands that can be used to compile the `main.tex` LaTeX document into a PDF file. This ensures that the document is properly formatted and consistent with the citation style used in the document. For example, to compile a document called "mydocument.tex", the user would run the following commands:

```
pdflatex mydocument.tex
bibtex mydocument
pdflatex mydocument.tex
pdflatex mydocument.tex
```

The `sources.bib` file contains a collection of bibliographic references related to the Ergo project, covering topics such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, smart contracts, and alternative currency systems. These references provide a comprehensive overview of the research and development efforts related to the Ergo project and its underlying technologies and can be used as a starting point for further research and development in the field.

In summary, the `.autodoc/docs/json/papers/contractual` folder contains essential documentation and code for understanding and implementing contractual money using the Ergo platform. The `main.tex` file provides a detailed explanation of the concept and its use cases, while the `compile.sh` file helps compile the document into a readable format. The `sources.bib` file offers a collection of relevant references for further research and development.
