The code provided is a shell script that compiles a LaTeX document called "whitepaper.tex" into a PDF file called "whitepaper.pdf". The script first checks if the necessary LaTeX commands, "pdflatex" and "bibtex", are installed on the system by using the "command -v" command. If either of these commands is not found, the script prints an error message and exits with an error code of 1.

Assuming both commands are found, the script then proceeds to remove any existing "whitepaper.pdf" file in the current directory. It then runs "pdflatex" on "whitepaper.tex" to generate an initial PDF file. Next, it runs "bibtex" on "whitepaper" to generate a bibliography file. Finally, it runs "pdflatex" twice more to incorporate the bibliography into the PDF file and generate the final version of "whitepaper.pdf".

After the PDF file is generated, the script removes any auxiliary files generated during the compilation process, such as ".aux", ".log", ".bbl", ".blg", and ".out" files.

This script is likely used as part of a larger project that involves creating and maintaining a LaTeX document, such as a technical whitepaper or research paper. By automating the compilation process, the script saves time and reduces the chance of errors that can occur when manually running the necessary LaTeX commands. The script can be run from the command line by navigating to the directory containing "whitepaper.tex" and executing the script with "./script_name.sh".
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to compile a LaTeX document called "whitepaper.tex" into a PDF file called "whitepaper.pdf", and it also removes some auxiliary files generated during the compilation process.

2. What dependencies are required to run this script?
   
   This script requires the "pdflatex" and "bibtex" commands to be installed on the system. If they are not installed, the script will print an error message and exit. Additionally, some LaTeX packages and fonts may need to be installed, depending on the contents of the "whitepaper.tex" file.

3. Why are there multiple calls to pdflatex?
   
   The "pdflatex" command needs to be run multiple times in order to properly generate the table of contents, citations, and other cross-references in the document. The first call generates some auxiliary files that are used by subsequent calls to pdflatex and bibtex.
