The Ergo project is a blockchain platform designed for developing decentralized applications, with a focus on financial contracts. The code in this folder provides the technical documentation and implementation details for various aspects of the Ergo platform.

The `abstract.tex` file provides an overview of the Ergo project, highlighting its key features such as ErgoScript, support for light nodes, survivability approach, and self-amendable protocol. This file serves as a high-level introduction to the project for developers and users.

The `autolykos.tex` file describes the Autolykos consensus protocol, a unique Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm that is memory-hard and pool-resistant. This file provides the algorithms for block mining and solution verification, which are essential for implementing the Autolykos consensus protocol in the larger project.

The `compile.sh` file is a shell script that automates the compilation of a LaTeX document (in this case, "whitepaper.tex") into a PDF file. This script is useful for maintaining and updating the technical documentation of the Ergo project.

The `currency.tex` file explains the importance of Ergo's native token, Erg, and its role in ensuring the stability and security of the Ergo platform. This file provides details on the token's emission schedule and initial state, which are crucial for understanding the economics of the Ergo platform.

The `intro.tex` file serves as an introduction to the Ergo project, discussing the challenges faced by existing blockchain systems and how Ergo aims to address these challenges using the UTXO model.

The `money.tex` file describes how the Ergo platform enables developers to create custom tokens and flexible, secure financial applications using a domain-specific language. This file provides examples of various applications that can be built on top of the Ergo platform, such as oracles, non-interactive mixing, atomic swaps, and initial coin offerings.

The `references.bib` file is a collection of citations for various articles, reports, and online resources related to the Ergo project. These citations provide background information, technical details, and examples of how the Ergo project can be used in real-world scenarios.

The `social_contract.tex` file outlines the main principles that should be followed in the Ergo protocol, referred to as "Ergo's Social Contract." These principles guide the development and use of the protocol, emphasizing decentralization, accessibility, and long-term sustainability.

The `survivability.tex` file focuses on the resiliency and survivability of the Ergo platform, addressing potential issues such as performance degradation, adaptability to external conditions, and lack of secure trustless light clients.

The `utxo.tex` file explains the design of the Ergo state, which is used to check new transactions in the Ergo cryptocurrency. The state is represented using one-time coins called boxes, which provide several advantages over Ethereum's long-lived mutable accounts.

The `whitepaper.tex` file is a comprehensive guide to the Ergo platform, providing developers and users with the information they need to understand how the platform works and how to use it to create and execute smart contracts.

Overall, the code in this folder serves as the technical documentation for the Ergo project, providing developers and users with the information they need to understand the platform's features, design principles, and implementation details.
