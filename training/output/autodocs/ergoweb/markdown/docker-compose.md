This code is a configuration file for a Docker container that runs a web application. The web application is built using the Next.js framework and is served on port 3000. The Docker container is configured to expose port 8080 on the host machine, which allows users to access the web application through a web browser.

The `services` section of the configuration file defines a single service called `web`. This service is built using the Dockerfile located in the current directory (`.`). The Dockerfile specifies the dependencies and configuration needed to run the web application.

The `environment` section of the configuration file sets an environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` to the URL of a Strapi API. Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that provides a backend for the web application. The web application uses this API to fetch data and content from the CMS.

The `ports` section of the configuration file maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 3000 in the Docker container. This allows users to access the web application by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in a web browser.

Overall, this configuration file is an essential part of the Ergoweb project as it enables the web application to run in a Docker container and connect to a Strapi API. Developers can use this configuration file to build and deploy the web application on different environments, such as local development machines or cloud servers. Here is an example of how to run the Docker container using this configuration file:

```
docker-compose up
```
