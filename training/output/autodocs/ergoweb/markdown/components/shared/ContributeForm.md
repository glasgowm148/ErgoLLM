The `ContributeForm` component is a React component that renders a form for users to contribute to the Ergo project. The component imports several modules, including `react-intl` for internationalization, `react-toastify` for displaying toast messages, and a custom `Button` component. 

The component defines several variables that use the `useIntl` hook to format messages for internationalization. These variables are used to set the text for various buttons and form inputs. 

The component also defines a `sendMessage` function that is called when the form is submitted. This function sends a POST request to a Strapi API endpoint with the user's name, email, and message. If the request is successful, a success message is displayed using the `toast` function from `react-toastify`.

The component renders a form with inputs for the user's name, email, and message, as well as several buttons that link to various resources related to contributing to the Ergo project. The form and buttons are styled using Tailwind CSS classes.

Overall, this component provides a user-friendly way for users to contribute to the Ergo project and access relevant resources.
