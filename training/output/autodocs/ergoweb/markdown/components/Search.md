The `Search` component is a React component that provides a search bar functionality for the Ergoweb project. It allows users to search for blog posts by title, subtitle, or content. 

The component uses the `useRef`, `useState`, and `useCallback` hooks from React. The `searchRef` is used to reference the search input element, while `query` and `results` are used to store the search query and results, respectively. `active` is used to track whether the search bar is active or not.

The `searchEndpoint` function constructs the search endpoint URL using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` environment variable and the search query. The endpoint URL includes sorting by date in descending order, pagination with a page size of 100, and filtering by title, subtitle, or content that contains the search query.

The `onChange` function is called whenever the search input value changes. It sets the `query` state to the new value and fetches the search results using the `searchEndpoint` function. The results are then stored in the `results` state.

The `onFocus` function is called whenever the search input is focused. It sets the `active` state to `true` and adds a click event listener to the window to detect clicks outside the search bar.

The `onClick` function is called whenever a click event occurs on the window. If the click is outside the search bar, it sets the `active` state to `false` and removes the click event listener from the window.

The `return` statement renders the search bar and the search results. If the search bar is active and there are search results, it renders a list of search cards that link to the corresponding blog posts. If there are no search results and the search query is not empty, it displays a message indicating that no results were found.

Overall, the `Search` component provides a simple and intuitive search functionality for the Ergoweb project. It can be easily integrated into other components and pages that require search capabilities.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useCallback` hook in this code?
   - The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize the `onChange` and `onFocus` functions, which helps to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

2. What is the significance of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` environment variable?
   - The `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` environment variable is used to construct the search endpoint URL, which is used to fetch search results from a Strapi API.

3. What is the purpose of the `active` state variable?
   - The `active` state variable is used to determine whether or not to display the search results. It is set to `true` when the search input is focused and set to `false` when the user clicks outside of the search input.
