This code exports a large number of components from various files within the `ergoweb` project. These components include icons, logos, and other graphical elements that may be used throughout the project. 

By exporting these components, they can be easily imported and used in other files within the project. For example, if a developer wanted to use the `Logo` component in a particular page or component, they could simply import it like so: 

```
import { Logo } from 'ergoweb';
```

This would allow them to use the `Logo` component within their code. 

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and make accessible various graphical elements that are used throughout the `ergoweb` project. By exporting them in this way, developers can easily use and reuse these components in different parts of the project.
