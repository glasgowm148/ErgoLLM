The code defines a React component called `SvgXWhiteHighlighted` that renders an SVG image. The image consists of three paths: a white stroke around a rounded rectangle, a white checkmark inside the rectangle, and an orange X inside a smaller rectangle in the bottom right corner. The stroke and checkmark paths have fixed dimensions and positions, while the X path is defined using absolute coordinates.

This component could be used in various parts of the ergoweb project to display a highlighted or selected item, such as a button or a list item. It could also be used as an icon to indicate a negative or error state, due to the presence of the X symbol. The component can be imported and used in other React components like this:

```
import SvgXWhiteHighlighted from 'path/to/SvgXWhiteHighlighted';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Selected Items:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Item 1 <SvgXWhiteHighlighted /></li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3 <SvgXWhiteHighlighted /></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `SvgXWhiteHighlighted` component is used inside list items to indicate which items are currently selected. The component's dimensions and colors can be customized using props, such as `width`, `height`, `stroke`, and `fill`.
