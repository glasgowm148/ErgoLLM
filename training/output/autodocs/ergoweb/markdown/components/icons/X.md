The `SvgX` component is a React functional component that renders an SVG image of an X symbol. The SVG has a width and height of 43 pixels and consists of two paths. The first path is a circle with a stroke color of `#585858` and a stroke width of 2. The second path is the X symbol itself, which is filled with the same color.

This component can be used in the larger project as a reusable component for displaying an X symbol in various contexts. For example, it could be used as an icon for a delete button or to indicate a close action. The component can be imported and used in other React components like so:

```
import SvgX from 'path/to/SvgX';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Are you sure you want to delete?</h2>
      <button onClick={handleDelete}>
        <SvgX />
        Delete
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `SvgX` component is used as an icon next to the "Delete" button to indicate that clicking the button will delete something. The `SvgX` component can be easily customized by passing props like `width`, `height`, and `color` to change its appearance.
