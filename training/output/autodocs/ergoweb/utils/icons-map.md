The code defines a function called `getIconComponentByName` that returns an SVG icon component based on the name passed as an argument. The function takes two arguments: `name` and `props`. The `name` argument is a string that represents the name of the icon component to be returned. The `props` argument is an optional object that contains additional properties to be passed to the icon component.

The function uses an object called `ComponentsMap` to map the icon names to their corresponding components. Each key in the `ComponentsMap` object is a string that represents the name of an icon, and each value is the corresponding SVG icon component. For example, the key "CheckDark" maps to the `CheckDark` component from the `../components/icons` module.

If the `name` argument matches a key in the `ComponentsMap` object, the function returns the corresponding SVG icon component with any additional properties passed in the `props` argument. If the `name` argument does not match any key in the `ComponentsMap` object, the function returns `null`.

This function is likely used throughout the larger project to render SVG icons in various components. For example, a component that displays a list of items may use this function to render an icon next to each item. The component would pass the name of the icon as a prop to the `getIconComponentByName` function, and the function would return the corresponding SVG icon component to be rendered. 

Example usage:

```
import { getIconComponentByName } from 'ergoweb';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
      {getIconComponentByName('CheckDark', { size: 24 })}
      <p>This is some text.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `getIconComponentByName` function is used to render the `CheckDark` SVG icon component with a size of 24 pixels. The icon is rendered between the `h1` and `p` elements.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports a function that returns an SVG icon component based on the provided icon name.

2. What parameters does the exported function take?
- The exported function takes a required string parameter `name` which represents the name of the icon, and an optional `props` parameter which can be used to pass additional props to the returned icon component.

3. What icons are available to be returned by the exported function?
- The exported function contains a map of available icons, each represented by a key-value pair where the key is the name of the icon and the value is the corresponding SVG icon component.
