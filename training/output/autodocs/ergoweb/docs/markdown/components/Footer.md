The `Footer` component in this code file is responsible for rendering the footer section of the Ergoweb project. It fetches and displays the latest blog posts and news articles, as well as providing navigation links to various sections of the website, social media icons, and contact information.

The component uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to manage the state of the fetched data. The `locale` variable is obtained from the `useRouter` hook, which is used to fetch the data in the user's preferred language. The `fetchData` function is defined within the `useEffect` hook, which fetches the latest blog posts and news articles from the API and updates the state variables `postsData` and `newsData`.

The footer is divided into several sections, including the logo, social media icons, contact information, and navigation links to various sections of the website. The social media icons are rendered using the `getIconComponentByName` utility function, which returns the appropriate icon component based on the provided name.

The navigation links are organized into columns, with each column containing a title and a list of links. The titles are wrapped in `Link` components, which navigate to the corresponding sections of the website when clicked. The list of links is conditionally rendered based on the length of the `postsData` and `newsData` arrays, ensuring that the blog and news sections are only displayed if there is data to show.

The footer also includes the Ergo Platform copyright information, privacy policy, and legal links, as well as the BpsaaLogo component and the physical address of the company.

Overall, this `Footer` component serves as a consistent and informative section at the bottom of the Ergoweb project, providing users with easy access to important information and resources.
