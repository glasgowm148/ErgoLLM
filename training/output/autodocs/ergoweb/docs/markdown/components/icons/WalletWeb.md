The `SvgWalletWeb` component is a React functional component that renders an SVG icon of a wallet. The icon is 20x20 pixels in size and has a white fill color. The purpose of this code is to provide a reusable wallet icon that can be used throughout the Ergoweb project.

The icon consists of several path elements that define the shape of the wallet. The `d` attribute of each path element contains a series of commands that specify the path of the shape. The commands include `M` for moving to a point, `L` for drawing a line, and `Z` for closing the path. The specific path commands used in this icon are not important for understanding the high-level purpose of the code.

The component takes in a `props` object, but it is not used in the code. This suggests that the component is meant to be used as a standalone icon and does not require any customization.

To use this component in the Ergoweb project, it can be imported and rendered like any other React component. For example:

```
import SvgWalletWeb from 'path/to/SvgWalletWeb';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Wallet</h1>
      <SvgWalletWeb />
    </div>
  );
};
```

This would render the wallet icon alongside the heading "My Wallet". The icon can be styled using CSS, just like any other SVG element.

Overall, the `SvgWalletWeb` component provides a simple and reusable way to include a wallet icon in the Ergoweb project.
