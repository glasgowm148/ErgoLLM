The `HomeHero` component is a React component that renders a hero section on the homepage of the ErgoWeb project. The hero section consists of a title, a description, and a call-to-action button. The component also includes a background video that changes depending on the user's color scheme preference.

The `useIntl` hook from the `react-intl` library is used to provide internationalization support for the component. The `intl` object is used to format the text for the call-to-action button based on the user's locale.

The title and description are rendered using the `FormattedMessage` component from the `react-intl` library. This component allows for the dynamic rendering of text based on the user's locale. The `id` prop is used to identify the text to be rendered, and the `defaultMessage` prop is used as a fallback in case the text is not available in the user's locale.

The call-to-action button is rendered using the `Button` component from the `../Button` module. The `text` prop is used to set the text of the button, and the `url` prop is used to set the URL that the button links to. The `background` prop is used to set the background color of the button, and the `icon` prop is used to set the icon that appears on the button.

The background video is rendered using the `video` element. The `autoPlay`, `playsInline`, `loop`, and `muted` props are used to configure the video playback. The `disablePictureInPicture` and `controlsList` props are used to disable picture-in-picture mode and the download button, respectively. The `source` element is used to specify the video file to be played.

Overall, the `HomeHero` component provides an engaging and informative introduction to the ErgoWeb project, with support for internationalization and dynamic content rendering.
## Questions:

   - The `useIntl` hook is used to access the internationalization API provided by the `react-intl` library. In this code, it is used to format the text for the button component based on the user's locale.
2. What is the significance of the `id` prop in the `FormattedMessage` components?
   - The `id` prop is used to identify the message that needs to be translated. It is used as a key to look up the translated message in the translation files.
3. What is the purpose of the `values` prop in the `FormattedMessage` component for the `components.homeHero.text` message?
