The `UniqueErgo` component is a React component that renders a section of the Ergo website that showcases the unique features of the Ergo blockchain. The component consists of a set of cards, each of which represents a unique feature of the Ergo blockchain. Each card contains a title, a text description, an icon, and a button that links to more information about the feature.

The component uses the `useEffect` hook to add a click event listener to each card. When a card is clicked, it becomes the active card and its description is displayed. The active card is highlighted with a border and a label that displays the card's icon and title.

The component uses the `FormattedMessage` component from the `react-intl` library to provide internationalization support for the card titles and descriptions. The `Button` component is also used to render the buttons on each card.

Overall, the `UniqueErgo` component is an important part of the Ergo website as it helps to showcase the unique features of the Ergo blockchain in an interactive and engaging way.
