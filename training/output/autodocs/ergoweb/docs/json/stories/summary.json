The purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and reusable set of buttons that can be used throughout the larger ergoweb project. \n\nThe code imports two components, Button and Dark, from their respective files. The Button component is the main component being exported and is used to create different variations of buttons. The Dark component is a wrapper component that provides a dark background for the buttons.\n\nThe exported object contains a title, the Button component, and an array of decorators. The decorators are higher-order components that wrap the Button component with additional functionality. In this case, the Dark component is used to provide a dark background for the buttons.\n\nThe code then defines a Template function that takes in arguments and returns a Button component with those arguments. This function is used to create different variations of the Button component.\n\nThe code then exports several variations of the Button component, each with different properties. These variations include a Button with an arrow, a Button without an arrow with black text, a Button without an arrow with white text, a Link with an arrow, and a long Link with no icon. Each variation is given a name and a set of properties that define its appearance and behavior.\n\nThis code can be used throughout the ergoweb project to create consistent and reusable buttons. Developers can import these pre-configured buttons and use them in their components without having to define the properties each time. For example, a developer can import the ButtonWithArrow component and use it in their component like this:\n\n```\nimport { ButtonWithArrow } from 'ergoweb';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ButtonWithArrow text=\"Click me!\" url=\"https://example.com\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis would create a ButtonWithArrow component with the text \"Click me!\" and a URL of \"https://example.com\". The appearance and behavior of the button would be consistent with the other pre-configured buttons defined in this file.",

          "summary": "This code is responsible for exporting a component called `HomePage` that renders the `Home` component from the `../../pages/index` file. The `HomePage` component receives props such as `posts`, `partners`, `news`, `info`, and `blockReward` from a higher-order component. \n\nThe `HomePage` component also has a `loaders` property that is an array containing an asynchronous function. This function uses the `getServerSideProps` function from the `../../pages/index` file to fetch data from the server-side and return it as props to the `HomePage` component. The `locale` parameter is passed to the `getServerSideProps` function to specify the language of the data to be fetched.\n\nThis code is likely part of a larger project that involves rendering a homepage for a website or web application. The `Home` component is likely a reusable component that is used throughout the project to render the homepage. The `HomePage` component is a specific instance of the `Home` component that receives data from a higher-order component and uses it to render the homepage.\n\nHere is an example of how the `HomePage` component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport HomePage from \"./components/HomePage\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const data = {\n    posts: [...],\n    partners: [...],\n    news: [...],\n    info: {...},\n    blockReward: 100,\n  };\n\n  return <HomePage loaded={data} />;\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `App` component renders the `HomePage` component and passes in data as a prop. The `HomePage` component uses this data to render the homepage. The `loaders` property in the `HomePage` component ensures that the data is fetched from the server-side before the component is rendered.",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `HomePage` function and what are the arguments it takes in?\n- The `HomePage` function is a component that renders the `Home` component with data passed in as props. It takes in `args` and a destructured object with properties `loaded` that contains data for `posts`, `partners`, `news`, `info`, and `blockReward`.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `HomePage.loaders` array and what does it contain?\n- The `HomePage.loaders` array contains an asynchronous function that retrieves data from the server-side props of the `Home` page with the locale set to \"en\". This data is then returned as props for the `HomePage` component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `export default` statement and what does it export?\n- The `export default` statement exports an object with properties `title` and `component`. The `title` property is a string that sets the title of the storybook page for the `Home` component, while the `component` property is the `Home` component itself."

The purpose of this module is to provide a way to import and use the Legal page component in other parts of the project.\n\nThe `import` statement at the beginning of the code imports the `Legal` component from the `../../pages/legal` file. This means that the `Legal` component is located in a file that is two directories up from the current file.\n\nThe exported object has two properties: `title` and `component`. The `title` property is a string that represents the title of the Legal page. The `component` property is a reference to the `Legal` component that was imported at the beginning of the code.\n\nThe `export const LegalPage` statement exports a new component called `LegalPage`. This component is a functional component that simply renders the `Legal` component that was imported earlier. This allows other parts of the project to import and use the `LegalPage` component instead of directly importing and using the `Legal` component.\n\nHere is an example of how this module might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport { LegalPage } from \"../components/legalPage\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>\n      <LegalPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `LegalPage` component is imported from the `../components/legalPage` file and used in the `App` component.

Each file exports a default object with a `title` and a `component` property, as well as a named export that renders the respective page component.\n\nFor example, the `404.stories.jsx` file exports a story for a custom 404 page component. The `Custom404Page` component can be used in the project's routing configuration to display a custom 404 page when a user navigates to a non-existent page:\n\n```javascript\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Custom404Page from \"./Custom404Page\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={HomePage} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/about\" component={AboutPage} />\n        <Route component={Custom404Page} />\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, the `500.stories.jsx` file exports a `Custom500Page` component that can be used to display a custom error page for server errors.
