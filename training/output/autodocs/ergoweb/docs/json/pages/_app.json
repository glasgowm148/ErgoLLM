  "summary": "The code is a Next.js application that sets up an internationalization (i18n) system for the Ergoweb project. It imports various language files in JSON format and uses the `react-intl` library to provide translations for different locales. \n\nThe `MyApp` function is the main component that wraps around all other components in the application. It takes two props, `Component` and `pageProps`, which are provided by Next.js. \n\nThe `useRouter` hook from Next.js is used to get the current locale from the URL. The `handleRouteChange` function is called whenever the route changes, and it sends a page view event to Google Analytics using the `gtag` function. \n\nThe `messages` variable is a memoized object that contains the translations for the current locale. It uses a `switch` statement to return the appropriate language file based on the `shortLocale` variable. If the current locale is not supported, it defaults to English. \n\nThe `Script` component from Next.js is used to load the Google Tag Manager script and set up the analytics tracking. The `ThemeProvider` component from `next-themes` is used to provide a theme context to the application. \n\nFinally, the `IntlProvider` component from `react-intl` is used to wrap the entire application and provide the translations to all child components. The `NextNProgress` component is used to display a progress bar at the top of the page when a new route is loading. \n\nOverall, this code sets up a robust i18n system for the Ergoweb project, allowing users to view the website in multiple languages. It also provides analytics tracking using Google Analytics and a theme context using `next-themes`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Script` components being used in this code?\n- The `Script` components are being used to load and execute external scripts, specifically the Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics scripts.\n\n2. How are different languages being supported in this app?\n- Different languages are being supported by importing JSON files containing translated messages for each language, and then selecting the appropriate messages based on the user's locale.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?\n- The `useEffect` hook is being used to add and remove an event listener for the `routeChangeComplete` event of the `router` object, which is used to track page views with Google Analytics."
