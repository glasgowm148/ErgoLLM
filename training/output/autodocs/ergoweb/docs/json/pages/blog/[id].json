  "summary": "The `Post` component is a React component that renders a blog post page. It imports several components and libraries, including `Layout`, `ReactMarkdown`, `Image`, `Button`, `Link`, and `BlogPosts`. The component takes in two props, `post` and `posts`, which are objects containing data about the current post and a list of all blog posts, respectively.\n\nThe component first checks if the current post has an image associated with it and sets the `hasImage` and `imageUrl` variables accordingly. It then renders the blog post page, which includes the post title, author, date, tags, subtitle, content, and social media sharing buttons. The `ReactMarkdown` component is used to render the post content in markdown format. The `Button` component is used to render a button that links back to the blog homepage. The `Link` component is used to wrap the social media sharing buttons and link them to their respective sharing URLs.\n\nThe `getServerSideProps` function is an asynchronous function that fetches the data for the current post and all blog posts from a Strapi API. It takes in a `context` object that contains information about the current request, including the query parameters. The function first fetches the current post data by filtering the posts by permalink and locale. It then fetches all blog posts by filtering the posts by type and sorting them by date in descending order. If the current post data is not found, the function returns a `notFound` object. Otherwise, it returns an object containing the `post` and `posts` data.\n\nThis component is used in the larger project to render individual blog post pages. It is likely used in conjunction with other components and pages to create a complete blog website.",
  "questions": "1. What external libraries or packages are being used in this code?\n- The code is importing several external libraries and components such as `react-intl`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `remark-breaks`, `rehype-raw`, `next/image`, `next/link`, and custom components like `Layout`, `Button`, `BlogFacebook`, `BlogLink`, `BlogTwitter`, `LogoBlack`, and `BlogPosts`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `getServerSideProps` function?\n- The `getServerSideProps` function is used to fetch data from an external API (presumably Strapi CMS) and pass it as props to the `Post` component. It is also used to handle cases where the requested post is not found.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `hasImage` and `imageUrl` variables?\n- The `hasImage` variable is used to determine whether the post has an image or not, while the `imageUrl` variable is used to store the URL of the image to be displayed. The code checks if the post has a `blogPhoto` attribute or an `image` attribute with a `url` attribute, and sets `hasImage` to `true` and `imageUrl` accordingly."
