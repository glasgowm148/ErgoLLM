  "summary": "The `Community` component is a React component that renders the community page of the Ergoweb project. It imports several other components from the `../components/community` and `../components/shared` directories, which are used to display various sections of the community page.\n\nThe `Community` component takes in an optional `props` object that can contain two properties: `posts` and `teamMembers`. These properties are used to populate the `Feed` and `HallOfFame` components, respectively. The `getServerSideProps` function is used to fetch the latest blog posts and team members from the Strapi API and pass them as props to the `Community` component.\n\nThe `useIntl` hook is used to format the `title` of the page based on the user's locale. The `Layout` component is used to render the page layout, which includes the `CommunityHero`, `CommunityCardsFeed`, `Sigmanauts`, `ContributeForm`, `Spotlight`, `Feed`, `HallOfFame`, `ErgoFoundation`, and `OurMission` components.\n\nThe `div` elements with class names starting with `community-frame` and `community-blur` are used to render a decorative frame around the page content.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Community` component can be used in the larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport Community from './Community';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Community />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis will render the `Community` component, which will fetch the latest blog posts and team members from the Strapi API and display them on the community page of the Ergoweb project.",
