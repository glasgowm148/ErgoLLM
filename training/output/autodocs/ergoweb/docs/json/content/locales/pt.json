  "summary": "The code provided is a JSON object containing key-value pairs that map to various text strings used throughout the Ergoweb project. These strings are used to populate the text content of various components and pages within the project. \n\nFor example, the \"components.ContributeForm.company.title\" key maps to the string \"Sou uma <b>empresa</b>\", which is used as the title of a form component for companies looking to contribute to the project. Similarly, the \"components.homeHero.text\" key maps to the string \"Ergo é uma plataforma de contratos inteligentes da nova geração que garante liberdade econômica de pessoas comuns através de ferramentas financeiras descentralizadas, acessíveis e seguras.\", which is used as the main text content of the homepage hero component.\n\nBy centralizing these text strings in a single JSON object, the Ergoweb project can easily manage and update the text content of its various components and pages without having to modify the code of each individual component or page. This makes it easier to maintain and update the project over time.\n\nOverall, this code serves as a simple but important tool for managing the text content of the Ergoweb project, allowing for easy updates and maintenance of the project's various components and pages.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the \"ContributeForm\" component?\n   - The \"ContributeForm\" component is used to allow companies and developers to contribute to the Ergo project.\n\n2.
