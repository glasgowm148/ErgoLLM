  "summary": "This code is a JSON file containing key-value pairs of text strings in Chinese, which are used for the localization of the Ergoweb project. Localization is the process of adapting a product or content to a specific locale or market. In this case, the JSON file provides the Chinese translations for various components, titles, buttons, and descriptions used throughout the Ergoweb platform.\n\nFor example, the key `\"components.ContributeForm.company.title\"` has the value `\"我是一家<b>公司</b>\"`, which translates to \"I am a <b>company</b>\" in English. Similarly, the key `\"components.Sigmanauts.button\"` has the value `\"阅读更多并申请\"`, which translates to \"Read more and apply\" in English.\n\nThese key-value pairs are used by the Ergoweb platform to display the appropriate text in Chinese when the user selects the Chinese language. This helps make the platform more accessible and user-friendly for Chinese-speaking users.\n\nTo use these translations in the project, developers would typically access the values using the keys provided in the JSON file. For example, in a JavaScript or TypeScript file, the developer might use the following code to display the title for the ContributeForm component:\n\n```javascript\nconst title = translations[\"components.ContributeForm.company.title\"];\n```\n\nThis would set the `title` variable to the Chinese translation, which can then be used to render the text on the web page.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n\n   This code appears to be a JSON file containing translations for a project called Ergoweb. It seems to be used for internationalization (i18n) purposes, providing translations for various components and text elements within the application.\n\n2. **What language are the translations in this file for?**\n\n   The translations in this file are in Simplified Chinese.\n\n3. **How can a developer add translations for a new language?**\n\n   To add translations for a new language, a developer would need to create a new JSON file with the same structure as this one, but with translations in the desired language. They would then need to integrate the new translation file into the project's internationalization system."
