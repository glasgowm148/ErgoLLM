  "summary": "The `News` component is responsible for rendering the latest news and blog posts on the Ergoweb website. It receives a prop called `news`, which is an array of objects containing information about each post, such as the title, subtitle, date, and URL. \n\nThe component is built using React and several third-party libraries, including `react-intl` for internationalization, `swiper` for the carousel, and a custom `Button` component. \n\nThe component is divided into two main sections: the title and the carousel. The title is a simple heading that displays the words \"News & Blog\" in a stylized format. The carousel is a Swiper component that displays each post as a slide. \n\nEach slide contains the post's date, title, subtitle, and a \"READ\" button that links to the full post. The date is formatted using the `FormattedDate` component from `react-intl`, which formats the date based on the user's locale. The \"READ\" button is a custom `Button` component that takes several props, including the text to display, the URL to link to, and the color scheme. \n\nThe carousel is responsive and includes pagination bullets that allow the user to navigate between slides. The pagination is implemented using the `Pagination` module from `swiper`. \n\nOverall, the `News` component is a key part of the Ergoweb website, providing users with easy access to the latest news and blog posts. It is flexible and customizable, allowing developers to easily add new posts and customize the styling and functionality of the carousel. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport News from './News';\n\nconst news = [\n  {\n    attributes: {\n      title: 'New Product Launch',\n      subtitle: 'Introducing our latest ergonomic chair',\n      date: '2022-01-01',\n      url: '/blog/new-product-launch',\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    attributes: {\n      title: 'Ergonomic Tips for Remote Work',\n      subtitle: 'Stay comfortable and productive while working from home',\n      date: '2021-12-01',\n      url: '/blog/ergonomic-tips-for-remote-work',\n    },\n  },\n  // more posts...\n];\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <News news={news} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
