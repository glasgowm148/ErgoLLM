  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a slideshow of highlights for the Ergo blockchain platform. The component uses the Swiper library to create a responsive and interactive slideshow that displays information about the platform's features and values. \n\nThe component imports the FormattedMessage component from the react-intl library, which is used to display localized messages. It also imports the Swiper and Navigation components from the Swiper library, which are used to create the slideshow. Finally, it imports the getIconComponentByName function from the utils/icons-map module, which is used to display SVG icons.\n\nThe component defines an array of objects called slides, each of which contains information about a specific highlight. Each slide object contains a titleMessage, quoteMessage, textMessage, and an SVG icon. The titleMessage, quoteMessage, and textMessage properties are all FormattedMessage components that display localized messages. The SVG icon is displayed using the getIconComponentByName function, which takes the name of the icon and some additional properties like the viewBox, height, and width.\n\nThe component then defines a FormattedMessageFixed function that simply returns a FormattedMessage component. This function is used to fix a bug in the react-intl library that causes an error when a FormattedMessage component is used inside a SwiperSlide component.\n\nFinally, the component defines a Highlights function that renders the slideshow. The function returns a div element that contains the Swiper component and some other elements like a title and some text. The Swiper component iterates over the slides array and renders a SwiperSlide component for each slide. The SwiperSlide component contains the content for each slide, which includes the SVG icon, the title, the quote, and the text.\n\nThe Highlights component is used in the larger Ergo web application to showcase the platform's features and values to users. The component is responsive and interactive, making it easy for users to navigate through the highlights and learn more about the platform. The use of localized messages and SVG icons also helps to make the component more accessible and user-friendly.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Highlights` component?\n- The `Highlights` component is responsible for rendering a slideshow of three slides that highlight different features of the Ergo platform.\n\n2. What is the role of the `FormattedMessageFixed` function?\n- The `FormattedMessageFixed` function is a custom wrapper around the `FormattedMessage` component from the `react-intl` library. It is used to provide default messages and values for the `titleMessage`, `quoteMessage`, and `textMessage` properties of each slide.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `getIconComponentByName` function?\n- The `getIconComponentByName` function is used to dynamically render an SVG icon based on its name.
