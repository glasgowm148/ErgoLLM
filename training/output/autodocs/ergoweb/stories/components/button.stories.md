This code exports a set of pre-configured Button components with different styles and properties. The purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and reusable set of buttons that can be used throughout the larger ergoweb project. 

The code imports two components, Button and Dark, from their respective files. The Button component is the main component being exported and is used to create different variations of buttons. The Dark component is a wrapper component that provides a dark background for the buttons.

The exported object contains a title, the Button component, and an array of decorators. The decorators are higher-order components that wrap the Button component with additional functionality. In this case, the Dark component is used to provide a dark background for the buttons.

The code then defines a Template function that takes in arguments and returns a Button component with those arguments. This function is used to create different variations of the Button component.

The code then exports several variations of the Button component, each with different properties. These variations include a Button with an arrow, a Button without an arrow with black text, a Button without an arrow with white text, a Link with an arrow, and a long Link with no icon. Each variation is given a name and a set of properties that define its appearance and behavior.

This code can be used throughout the ergoweb project to create consistent and reusable buttons. Developers can import these pre-configured buttons and use them in their components without having to define the properties each time. For example, a developer can import the ButtonWithArrow component and use it in their component like this:

```
import { ButtonWithArrow } from 'ergoweb';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ButtonWithArrow text="Click me!" url="https://example.com" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This would create a ButtonWithArrow component with the text "Click me!" and a URL of "https://example.com". The appearance and behavior of the button would be consistent with the other pre-configured buttons defined in this file.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `decorators` array in the export statement?
   - The `decorators` array is used to wrap the `Button` component in a `Dark` component, which provides a dark background for the button.
2. What is the significance of the `args` object in each of the exported components?
   - The `args` object is used to pass props to the `Button` component, allowing for customization of the button's text, URL, icon, color, and other properties.
3. What is the difference between the `ButtonWithArrow`, `ButtonWithoutArrowBlack`, and `ButtonWithoutArrowWhite` components?
   - The `ButtonWithArrow` component includes a right arrow icon, while the `ButtonWithoutArrowBlack` and `ButtonWithoutArrowWhite` components do not. The `ButtonWithoutArrowBlack` component has black text, while the `ButtonWithoutArrowWhite` component has white text.
