  "summary": "The code provided is a JSON object containing key-value pairs that map to various text strings used throughout the Ergoweb project. These strings are used to populate text content on various pages and components of the website. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for managing and updating the text content used throughout the Ergoweb project. By storing all of the text strings in a single JSON file, it becomes easier to make updates and changes to the text content without having to search through multiple files and components. \n\nFor example, the \"components.ContributeForm.company.title\" key maps to the string \"<b>Cégeknek</b>\", which is used as the title for a form component on the \"Contribute\" page of the website. Similarly, the \"components.homeHero.text\" key maps to the string \"Ergo egy következő-generációs okos szerződés (smart contract) platform, amely biztosítja a gazdasági szabadásgot az átlagembernek biztonságos elérhető és központosítatlan pénzügyi eszközökkel.\", which is used as the main text content for the hero section on the homepage of the website. \n\nOverall, this code serves as a simple yet important component of the Ergoweb project, providing a centralized location for managing and updating text content used throughout the website.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the \"ContributeForm\" component and how does it work?\n- The \"ContributeForm\" component seems to be a form for companies and developers to contribute to Ergo, with separate sections for each. It is not clear from this code how the form is implemented or what information it collects.\n\n2. What is the Autolykos algorithm and how does it relate to Ergo's mining process?\n- The Autolykos algorithm is described as a memory-hard Proof of Work algorithm that is ASIC-resistant and GPU-oriented. It is used for mining Ergo, but it is not clear from this code how it is integrated into the mining process or what advantages it offers over other algorithms.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Sigmanauts\" component and how does it relate to Ergo's development?\n- The \"Sigmanauts\" component appears to be related to a training program for developers to contribute to Ergo. It is not clear from this code what the program entails or how it fits into Ergo's overall development strategy."
