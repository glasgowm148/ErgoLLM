  "summary": "The code above defines CSS styles for the ergoweb project. Specifically, it defines styles for a card component that can be used throughout the project. \n\nThe `.card.active` selector defines styles for a card that is currently active. It sets the flex-grow property to 1.5, which allows the card to grow to take up more space. It also sets the margin to 0 and the max-width to 100%, which ensures that the card takes up the full width of its container. The background-color is set to white, and there is a nested `.label` selector that defines styles for a label within the card. The label is translated slightly to the right and up using the `transform` property, and its child elements are given an opacity of 1 and a transform that moves them to the right. \n\nThe `.card.active .temphide` selector defines styles for a temporary hide element within the active card. It sets the display property to block and translates the element down using the `transform` property. \n\nThe `.dark .card.active` selector defines styles for an active card when the page is in dark mode. It sets the background-color to a dark gray color. \n\nFinally, the `.transition-base` selector defines a set of transition properties that can be used throughout the project. It sets the transition duration to 700ms, the transition property to all, and the transition timing function to a cubic-bezier function that defines the speed of the transition. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of reusable styles for a card component that can be used throughout the ergoweb project. The styles define how the card should look when it is active, how it should be hidden temporarily, and how it should look in dark mode. The transition properties defined in `.transition-base` can be used to add smooth transitions to other elements in the project.",
  "questions": "1. What does the `.card.active` class do?\n- The `.card.active` class sets the flex-grow property to 1.5, removes margin, sets max-width to 100%, and sets the background color to white. It also applies a transform to the `.label` class and its child elements.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `.temphide` class?\n- The `.temphide` class sets the display property to block and applies a transform to the Y-axis, likely used for animating the element.\n\n3. What is the `transition-base` class used for?\n- The `transition-base` class sets the transition properties for all elements, including the duration, property, timing function, and easing. It is likely used to create consistent animations throughout the project."
