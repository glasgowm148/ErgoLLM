  "summary": "This code defines the styles for a custom 404 error page for the Ergoweb project. The page is composed of several frames and blur effects that are positioned absolutely on the page. The frames are images that are loaded from the `/assets/not-found` directory and are displayed with no-repeat background properties. The blur effects are SVG images that are also loaded from the same directory.\n\nThe frames and blur effects are styled differently depending on whether the page is in \"dark\" mode or not. The `.dark` class is used to apply the dark mode styles. This is likely a feature of the larger Ergoweb project that allows users to switch between light and dark modes.\n\nThe code also includes media queries that adjust the positioning and scaling of the frames and blur effects for smaller screens. The `transform` property is used to scale and position the elements, and the `transform-origin` property is used to specify the point around which the element should be transformed.\n\nOverall, this code defines the styles for a custom 404 error page that is consistent with the design of the larger Ergoweb project. The use of absolute positioning and background images allows for a visually appealing and customizable error page. The media queries ensure that the page is responsive and looks good on screens of different sizes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `@import` statement at the beginning of the code?\n- The `@import` statement is importing the `_variables.scss` file into this file, which likely contains variables used throughout the project.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `.dark` class in this code?\n- The `.dark` class is used to apply different background images to the frames and blurs when the page is in dark mode.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the media query at the end of the code?\n- The media query is adjusting the positioning and scaling of the frames and blurs for smaller screens, likely to ensure they still look good and fit properly on mobile devices."
