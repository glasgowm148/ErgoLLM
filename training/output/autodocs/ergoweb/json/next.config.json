  "summary": "This code is a configuration file for the Next.js framework used in the ergoweb project. The file exports an object that contains various configuration options for the project. \n\nThe `async redirects()` function is used to define a list of URL redirects for the project. When a user navigates to a URL that matches one of the defined sources, they will be redirected to the corresponding destination URL. For example, if a user navigates to `/docs/some-document`, they will be redirected to `https://storage.googleapis.com/ergo-cms-media/docs/some-document`. \n\nThe `reactStrictMode` option enables React's strict mode, which helps identify potential issues in the code. The `trailingSlash` option adds a trailing slash to the end of URLs, which can help with SEO and consistency. \n\nThe `i18n` option is used to configure internationalization settings for the project. It defines a list of locales and sets the default locale to `default`. The `localeDetection` option is set to `false`, which means the project will not automatically detect the user's locale. \n\nThe `sassOptions` option is used to specify the location of the Sass files used in the project. The `pageExtensions` option is used to specify the file extensions that should be treated as pages in the project. \n\nThe `images` option is used to specify the domains from which images can be loaded in the project. \n\nFinally, the `withMDX` function is used to enable support for MDX files in the project. MDX is a format that allows for the use of JSX components in Markdown files. The `options` object passed to the `withMDX` function can be used to configure the behavior of the MDX compiler. \n\nOverall, this configuration file is used to define various settings and options for the ergoweb project, including URL redirects, internationalization settings, and support for MDX files.",
