  "summary": "This code is a shell script that is used to start a Next.js application. The purpose of this script is to check that the environment variables are set up correctly and to replace a specific string in the application files with the value of the environment variable. \n\nThe script starts by checking if the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` is set. If it is not set, the script will exit with an error message. If the variable is set, the script will continue to the next step.\n\nThe `find` command is then used to search for all files in the `.next` directory of the application, excluding any files in a `.git` directory. The `sed` command is then used to replace the string `APP_NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` with the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` environment variable. This is done to ensure that the application is using the correct API endpoint.\n\nFinally, the script starts the Next.js application by executing the command passed as arguments to the script. This allows the script to be used with different commands depending on the environment or deployment method.\n\nHere is an example of how this script might be used in a larger project:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Set the environment variable for the Strapi API endpoint\nexport NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API=\"https://api.example.com\"\n\n# Start the Next.js application using the script\n./start.sh npm run start\n```\n\nIn this example, the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` environment variable is set to the URL of the Strapi API endpoint. The `start.sh` script is then used to start the Next.js application by running the `npm run start` command. The script will replace the `APP_NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` string in the application files with the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` environment variable before starting the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `test` command and why is it being used in this script?\n   - The `test` command is being used to check if the environment variable `$NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` is set. If it is not set, the script will exit with an error.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `sed` command and what is it replacing?\n   - The `sed` command is being used to replace the string `APP_NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` with the value of the `$NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` environment variable in all files under the `/app/.next` directory.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `exec` command and what does the `$@` parameter represent?\n   - The `exec` command is being used to replace the current shell process with the command specified by the `$@` parameter. In this case, it is starting the Next.js application."
