  "summary": "The `Roadmap` component is responsible for rendering a roadmap view of the Ergo project. It imports several dependencies including `lodash`, `react-intl`, `Button`, and `getIconComponentByName`. The component takes in a single prop `roadmapItems` which is an array of objects containing information about the roadmap items. \n\nThe `processRoadmap` function takes in the `roadmap` and `sectionName` as arguments and returns an array of roadmap items that belong to the specified section. It first sorts the roadmap items by their `order` attribute and then filters them by their `group` attribute which is equal to the `sectionName` argument.\n\nThe `RoadmapItem` component takes in several props including `title`, `url`, `description`, and `status`. It renders a single roadmap item with an icon, title, and description. If the `url` prop is not null, it renders the item as a link. The icon displayed is determined by the `status` prop which can be one of three values: `completed`, `in_progress`, or `planned`. \n\nThe `Roadmap` component renders the entire roadmap view. It first defines an array of `sections` which contains the names and tags of each section. It then renders the title and description of the roadmap along with a button to view more information. Finally, it renders each section of the roadmap by mapping over the `sections` array and calling the `processRoadmap` function to filter the roadmap items by section. It then maps over the resulting array and renders each item using the `RoadmapItem` component.\n\nOverall, the `Roadmap` component provides a high-level view of the Ergo project roadmap and allows users to easily navigate through the different sections and items. It is a key component in providing transparency and communication to the Ergo community about the project's progress and plans.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `processRoadmap` function?\n- The `processRoadmap` function takes in a roadmap and a section name, sorts the data in the roadmap by order, filters the data by the specified section name, and returns the resulting data.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `RoadmapItem` component?\n- The `RoadmapItem` component is responsible for rendering a single item in the roadmap, including its title, description, status, and icon.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `sections` array?\n- The `sections` array contains objects representing different sections of the roadmap, each with a name and a tag. These sections are used to filter the roadmap data and display it in separate sections on the page."
