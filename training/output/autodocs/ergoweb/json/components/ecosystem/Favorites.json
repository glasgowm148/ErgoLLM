  "summary": "The `Favorites` component is a React component that displays a list of favorite posts and information about the ErgoRaffle crowdfunding service. The component receives a `favorites` prop, which is an array of post objects. Each post object contains attributes such as `title`, `subtitle`, `description`, `image`, `url`, and `button_text`. The component uses the `Swiper` component from the `swiper/react` library to display the list of posts in a carousel format. The `Swiper` component is also configured to display pagination bullets at the bottom of the carousel.\n\nThe component also displays information about the ErgoRaffle service, including an image of the ErgoRaffle logo, a description of the service, and a button that links to the ErgoRaffle website. The component uses the `useIntl` hook from the `react-intl` library to format the text of the button based on the user's locale.\n\nThe component uses several other components and utilities, including the `Button` component, the `Image` component from the `next/image` library, and the `getIconComponentByName` function from the `../../utils/icons-map` module.\n\nOverall, the `Favorites` component provides a user-friendly interface for displaying a list of favorite posts and promoting the ErgoRaffle crowdfunding service. It is designed to be easily customizable and extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionality as needed.",
