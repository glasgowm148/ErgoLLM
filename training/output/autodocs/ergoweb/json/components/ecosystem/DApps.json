  "summary": "The `DApps` component is a React functional component that renders a list of decentralized applications (DApps) on a web page. The component takes an optional `apps` prop, which is an array of objects representing the DApps to be displayed. Each DApp object contains properties such as `title`, `description`, `url`, and `image`. The component uses the `map` method to iterate over the `apps` array and render each DApp as a card with its title, image, and description.\n\nThe component also renders a header with the text \"DApps\" and a button that links to an external website. The button text is obtained from the `intl` object, which is provided by the `react-intl` library and allows for internationalization of the text. The button component is imported from a local `Button` module.\n\nThe image for each DApp is rendered using the `next/image` component, which is a third-party library that optimizes images for the web. If an image is not available for a DApp, a default image is displayed instead. The `Image` component takes the `src`, `width`, `height`, and `alt` attributes as props.\n\nThe component uses Tailwind CSS classes to style the layout and appearance of the DApp cards and the header. The `max-w-[1300px]` class limits the width of the component to 1300 pixels, while the `-mt-60` and `lg:-mt-[600px]` classes adjust the margin-top property to position the component on the page. The `no-scrollbar` class hides the horizontal scrollbar that appears when the DApps overflow the container.\n\nOverall, the `DApps` component provides a reusable and customizable way to display a list of DApps on a web page. It can be used in conjunction with other components and modules to build a larger decentralized application platform.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DApps` component?\n   - The `DApps` component is responsible for rendering a list of DApps (decentralized applications) along with their images, titles, and descriptions.\n2. What external libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?\n   - The code is using the `next/image` library for image optimization and the `react-intl` library for internationalization.\n3. What is the significance of the `apps` prop and how is it used in the component?\n   - The `apps` prop is an optional array of objects that contain information about each DApp to be rendered. It is used in a `.map()` function to dynamically render each DApp's image, title, and description."
