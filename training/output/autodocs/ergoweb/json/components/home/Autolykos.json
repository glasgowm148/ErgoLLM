  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a section of the Ergoweb website called Autolykos. The Autolykos section provides information about the Proof of Work algorithm used in the Ergo blockchain. The component imports two modules from the react-intl library: FormattedMessage and useIntl. FormattedMessage is used to format messages based on the user's locale, while useIntl is a hook that provides access to the internationalization API.\n\nThe Autolykos component renders two different layouts depending on the screen size. On small screens, the component renders a single column layout, while on larger screens, it renders a two-column layout. Both layouts contain the same information, but the two-column layout has a different arrangement of the content.\n\nThe component uses the useIntl hook to format the text of the button that links to the \"Get ERG\" page. The button text is obtained from the message with the ID \"components.autolykos.button\" and the default message \"MINE ERG\". The formatted message is stored in the button variable and passed as a prop to the Button component.\n\nThe Autolykos component also uses the FormattedMessage component to format the header, title, and text of the Autolykos section. The header is obtained from the message with the ID \"components.autolykos.header\", while the title is obtained from the message with the ID \"components.autolykos.title\". The text is obtained from the message with the ID \"components.autolykos.text\". The text message contains HTML tags, which are rendered using the values prop of the FormattedMessage component.\n\nThe Button component is a custom component that renders a button with an optional icon. The component accepts several props that control the appearance and behavior of the button, such as text, textColor, url, newTab, underline, background, iconColor, and icon.\n\nOverall, the Autolykos component provides an informative section about the Proof of Work algorithm used in the Ergo blockchain and encourages users to mine ERG by linking to the \"Get ERG\" page. The component uses the react-intl library to provide internationalization support and the Button component to render a customizable button.",
