  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a list of media posts. The component takes an array of media posts as a prop and maps over it to render each post using the `MediaPost` component. \n\nThe `MediaPost` component takes in a `MediaPostProps` object that contains the title, description, date, and link of the media post. It then renders the post with a title, date, description, and a \"READ\" button that links to the post. \n\nThe `FormattedDate` component from the `react-intl` library is used to format the date of the post. The `Button` component is imported from the `Button` file in the same directory and is used to render the \"READ\" button. \n\nThe `Media` component renders a heading \"Media About Us\" and a horizontal list of media posts using the `flex` and `space-x-8` classes. If there are no media posts, the component does not render anything. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display a list of media posts on a page. The `Media` component can be imported and used in any page that requires a list of media posts. The `MediaPost` component can also be used independently to render a single media post. \n\nExample usage of the `Media` component:\n\n```\nimport Media from './Media';\n\nfunction MediaPage() {\n  const mediaPosts = [\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      attributes: {\n        Title: 'Ergoweb featured in Forbes',\n        Description: 'Ergoweb was recently featured in Forbes for its innovative approach to ergonomics.',\n        Date: '2022-01-01',\n        Link: 'https://www.forbes.com/ergoweb-featured-in-forbes'\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id: 2,\n      attributes: {\n        Title: 'Ergoweb wins award',\n        Description: 'Ergoweb won the Best Ergonomics Company award at the 2022 Ergonomics Conference.',\n        Date: '2022-02-01',\n        Link: 'https://www.ergonomicsconference.com/awards'\n      }\n    }\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Media mediaPosts={mediaPosts} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
