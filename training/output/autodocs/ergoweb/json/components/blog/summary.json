      "summary": "The code is a React component that displays a list of news posts. It imports several dependencies, including `Link` from Next.js, `useState` from React, `InfiniteScroll` from `react-infinite-scroll-component`, `FormattedDate` from `react-intl`, and a custom `Button` component. \n\nThe `NewsPost` function is a child component that renders a single news post. It takes in four props: `title`, `subtitle`, `date`, and `url`. If `url` is not null, it renders a clickable `div` element that displays the post's date, title, and subtitle (if it exists). The `Button` component is also rendered at the bottom of the `div` element, which allows the user to read the full post. \n\nThe `BlogNews` function is the parent component that renders a list of news posts using the `NewsPost` component. It takes in a single prop `news`, which is an array of news posts. It uses the `useState` hook to initialize the `posts` state to the `news` prop and the `hasMore` state to `true`. \n\nThe `getMorePost` function is an asynchronous function that fetches more news posts from an API endpoint. It uses the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the API endpoint, passing in query parameters to sort the posts by date in descending order, limit the number of posts to 9, and filter by type \"news\". It then updates the `posts` state by concatenating the existing `posts` array with the new posts array. If there are no more posts to fetch, it sets the `hasMore` state to `false`. \n\nThe `BlogNews` component uses the `InfiniteScroll` component to render the list of news posts. It passes in the `posts` array length as the `dataLength` prop, the `getMorePost` function as the `next` prop, and the `hasMore` state as the `hasMore` prop. It also renders a loading spinner when new posts are being fetched and a message when there are no more posts to show. \n\nOverall, this code is a reusable component that can be used to display a list of news posts in a web application. It uses several third-party libraries to implement infinite scrolling and date formatting, and it fetches data from an API endpoint to dynamically load more posts as the user scrolls down the page.",
      "questions": "1. What external libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?\n- The code is using Next.js, React, react-infinite-scroll-component, and react-intl.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `NewsPost` component?\n- The `NewsPost` component is responsible for rendering a single news post with a title, subtitle, date, and URL.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getMorePost` function?\n- The `getMorePost` function is called when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page and is responsible for fetching more news posts from an external API and appending them to the existing list of posts."

      "summary": "The `BlogPosts` component is a React component that displays a list of blog posts. It uses the `InfiniteScroll` component from the `react-infinite-scroll-component` library to load more posts as the user scrolls down the page. \n\nThe component takes in a `data` prop, which is an array of blog post objects. It also takes an optional `locale` prop, which specifies the language of the blog posts to display, and a `filter` prop, which can be used to filter the posts by a specific category or tag. \n\nThe `useState` hook is used to manage the component's state. The `posts` state variable is initialized with the `data` prop, and is updated with new posts as they are loaded. The `hasMore` state variable is used to determine whether there are more posts to load.\n\nThe `getMorePost` function is called when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page and triggers the `next` prop of the `InfiniteScroll` component. It makes a GET request to the Strapi API to fetch more blog posts. The `pagination` query parameters are used to specify the range of posts to fetch, and the `filters` query parameter is used to filter the posts by type and category/tag. The `locale` prop is also included in the query string to fetch posts in the specified language. \n\nThe new posts are added to the `posts` state variable using the spread operator. If there are no more posts to load, the `hasMore` state variable is set to `false`.\n\nThe `return` statement renders the `InfiniteScroll` component, which wraps a grid of `Post` components. The `Post` component is a custom component that displays the details of a single blog post. The `key` prop is set to the `id` of the post, and the other props are set to the corresponding attributes of the post object. \n\nIf there are no posts to display, the `return` statement returns `null`.\n\nOverall, this component provides a reusable way to display a list of blog posts with infinite scrolling and filtering capabilities. It can be used in a larger project to display a blog page or a list of related posts on a content page.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `InfiniteScroll` component and how does it work?\n   - The `InfiniteScroll` component is used to implement infinite scrolling functionality, where more content is loaded as the user scrolls down the page. It works by calling the `getMorePost` function when the user reaches the end of the current content, which fetches more posts from the API and adds them to the existing `posts` state.\n\n2. What is the `filter` prop used for and how is it set?\n   - The `filter` prop is used to filter the blog posts based on a specific criteria, such as a tag or category. It is set by checking if the prop is undefined and setting it to an empty string if it is.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API` variable is used to store the URL of the Strapi API that is used to fetch the blog posts. It is defined in an environment variable file, which is not included in this code snippet."

      "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a list of media posts. The component takes an array of media posts as a prop and maps over it to render each post using the `MediaPost` component. \n\nThe `MediaPost` component takes in a `MediaPostProps` object that contains the title, description, date, and link of the media post. It then renders the post with a title, date, description, and a \"READ\" button that links to the post. \n\nThe `FormattedDate` component from the `react-intl` library is used to format the date of the post. The `Button` component is imported from the `Button` file in the same directory and is used to render the \"READ\" button. \n\nThe `Media` component renders a heading \"Media About Us\" and a horizontal list of media posts using the `flex` and `space-x-8` classes. If there are no media posts, the component does not render anything. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display a list of media posts on a page. The `Media` component can be imported and used in any page that requires a list of media posts. The `MediaPost` component can also be used independently to render a single media post. \n\nExample usage of the `Media` component:\n\n```\nimport Media from './Media';\n\nfunction MediaPage() {\n  const mediaPosts = [\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      attributes: {\n        Title: 'Ergoweb featured in Forbes',\n        Description: 'Ergoweb was recently featured in Forbes for its innovative approach to ergonomics.',\n        Date: '2022-01-01',\n        Link: 'https://www.forbes.com/ergoweb-featured-in-forbes'\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id: 2,\n      attributes: {\n        Title: 'Ergoweb wins award',\n        Description: 'Ergoweb won the Best Ergonomics Company award at the 2022 Ergonomics Conference.',\n        Date: '2022-02-01',\n        Link: 'https://www.ergonomicsconference.com/awards'\n      }\n    }\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Media mediaPosts={mediaPosts} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Media` component and what does it render?\n- The `Media` component renders a list of `MediaPost` components based on the `mediaPosts` prop passed to it.\n\n2. What are the required and optional props for the `MediaPost` component?\n- The required prop for the `MediaPost` component is `Title`, while the optional props are `Description`, `Date`, and `Link`. \n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Button` component and what props can be passed to it?\n- The `Button` component is used to render a button with customizable text, URL, and styling.

  "summary": "The `.autodoc/docs/json/components/blog` folder contains three React components that are used to display different types of content on a blog page, such as news posts, blog posts, and media posts. These components are designed to be reusable and can be imported into other parts of the project as needed.\n\n1. **BlogNews.tsx**: This component displays a list of news posts with infinite scrolling functionality. It fetches more news posts from an API endpoint as the user scrolls down the page. The `BlogNews` component takes in a `news` prop, which is an array of news post objects. It uses the `NewsPost` child component to render each post with its title, subtitle, date, and a link to the full post. The `InfiniteScroll` component from the `react-infinite-scroll-component` library is used to implement the infinite scrolling feature. Example usage:\n\n   ```jsx\n   import BlogNews from './BlogNews';\n\n   function NewsPage() {\n     const newsPosts = [\n       // Array of news post objects\n     ];\n\n     return (\n       <div>\n         <BlogNews news={newsPosts} />\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **BlogPosts.tsx**: This component displays a list of blog posts with infinite scrolling and filtering capabilities. It takes in a `data` prop, which is an array of blog post objects, an optional `locale` prop for specifying the language of the posts, and a `filter` prop for filtering the posts by category or tag. The `InfiniteScroll` component is used to load more posts as the user scrolls down the page. The `Post` child component is used to render each post with its title, date, and other attributes. Example usage:\n\n   ```jsx\n   import BlogPosts from './BlogPosts';\n\n   function BlogPage() {\n     const blogPosts = [\n       // Array of blog post objects\n     ];\n\n     return (\n       <div>\n         <BlogPosts data={blogPosts} locale=\"en\" filter={{ category: 'tech' }} />\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Media.tsx**: This component renders a list of media posts, such as articles or interviews about the project. It takes in a `mediaPosts` prop, which is an array of media post objects. The `MediaPost` child component is used to render each post with its title, description, date, and a link to the full post. The `FormattedDate` component from the `react-intl` library is used to format the date of the post. Example usage:\n\n   ```jsx\n   import Media from './Media';\n\n   function MediaPage() {\n     const mediaPosts = [\n       // Array of media post objects\n     ];\n\n     return (\n       <div>\n         <Media mediaPosts={mediaPosts} />\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\nThese components can be used together or separately to create a blog page or display related content on other pages of the project. They provide a flexible and modular way to manage and display different types of content with various features, such as infinite scrolling, filtering, and localization.",
