  "summary": "The `Mining` component is a React component that renders a page with information about mining Ergo, a cryptocurrency. The component contains two arrays of objects, `miningPoolsUrls` and `minersUrls`, which contain information about various mining pools and miners respectively. Each object in these arrays contains a `text` property, which is a React component that renders the name of the pool or miner, and a `url` property, which is the URL of the pool or miner's website. \n\nThe component renders a heading, followed by a grid of buttons that link to the various mining pools. The buttons are created using the `Button` component, which is imported from another file. Each button has a text label, an icon, and a link to the corresponding pool's website. The same pattern is repeated for the list of miners.\n\nThe component also contains several paragraphs of text that describe Ergo's mining algorithm and provide links to various resources for miners. The text is rendered using the `FormattedMessage` component from the `react-intl` library, which allows for easy localization of the text. \n\nOverall, the `Mining` component provides a user-friendly interface for miners to learn about and access various mining pools and miners for Ergo. It also provides links to additional resources for miners to learn more about Ergo's mining algorithm and community.",

What is the purpose of the `customClass` prop in the `Button` components?\n- The `customClass` prop is used to add a custom CSS class to the `Button` component, which can be used to apply additional styling or override existing styles."
