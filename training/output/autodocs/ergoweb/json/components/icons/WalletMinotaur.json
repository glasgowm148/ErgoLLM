  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `SvgWalletMinotaur` that renders an SVG image of a wallet with a Minotaur design. The SVG image consists of two `path` elements that define the shape and stroke of the image. The `stroke` attribute sets the color of the stroke to a bright orange (#ff4221) and the `strokeWidth` attribute sets the width of the stroke to 8 pixels.\n\nThe `SvgWalletMinotaur` component takes in `props` as an argument, which allows for any additional props to be passed down to the SVG element. The `viewBox` attribute sets the dimensions of the SVG image to 1337 x 1337 pixels, and the `width` and `height` attributes set the dimensions of the SVG element to 1337pt x 1337pt.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a decorative element, such as on a landing page or in a marketing campaign. It can be imported and rendered like any other React component:\n\n```\nimport SvgWalletMinotaur from './SvgWalletMinotaur';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to Ergoweb</h1>\n      <SvgWalletMinotaur />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable and visually appealing SVG component that can be used to enhance the user experience of the Ergoweb project.",
