  "summary": "The `SvgRoadmapPlanned` component is a React component that renders an SVG image of a circle with a gradient fill and a path element that creates a shape within the circle. The circle has a width of 29 and a height of 28, and its fill is defined by a linear gradient that goes from white to a dark gray color. The path element creates a shape that resembles a flag or a banner, and it is filled with a solid black color.\n\nThis component is likely used in the larger project as an icon or a visual element to represent a planned or upcoming feature or milestone in a roadmap or a project plan. It can be imported and used in other React components like this:\n\n```jsx\nimport SvgRoadmapPlanned from 'path/to/SvgRoadmapPlanned';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <SvgRoadmapPlanned />\n          Feature A\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <SvgRoadmapPlanned />\n          Feature B\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <SvgRoadmapPlanned />\n          Feature C\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SvgRoadmapPlanned` component is used to create a visual indicator for upcoming features in a list. The component can be reused multiple times with different feature names to create a consistent and recognizable visual language for the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component that renders an SVG image of a planned roadmap.\n\n2. What are the dimensions of the SVG image?\n- The SVG image has a width of 29 and a height of 28.\n\n3. What is the significance of the linear gradient defined in the code?\n- The linear gradient is used to fill the ellipse in the SVG image with a gradient that goes from white to a dark gray color."
