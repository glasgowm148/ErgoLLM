  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section on a web page. The component takes in a prop called `faq`, which is an array of objects containing question and answer data. The `processFaq` function sorts the questions in the `faq` array by their `order` attribute and returns the sorted array. \n\nThe rendered FAQ section consists of two columns: the left column contains a title, a subtitle, and a message, while the right column contains the questions and answers. The right column is an accordion-style list of questions and answers, where each question is a button that toggles the display of its corresponding answer. The questions and answers are generated dynamically from the `faq` prop using the `map` function. \n\nThe component uses several third-party libraries to render the FAQ section. The `lodash` library is used to sort the questions in the `processFaq` function. The `react-intl` library is used to internationalize the text in the component. The `react-markdown` library is used to render the answer text as Markdown, with support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and line breaks. The `tw-elements` library is loaded using the `useEffect` hook to add some custom styles to the FAQ section. \n\nThe component is responsive, with different layouts for small and large screens. On small screens, the left column is hidden, and the title, subtitle, and message are displayed above the questions and answers. On large screens, the left column is displayed, and the title, subtitle, and message are displayed above the questions and answers in the left column. \n\nOverall, this component provides a reusable and customizable way to display a FAQ section on a web page. The `faq` prop can be populated with different question and answer data to create different FAQ sections. The component can be styled using CSS to match the design of the web page.",
