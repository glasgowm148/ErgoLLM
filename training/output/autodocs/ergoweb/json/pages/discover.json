  "summary": "The `Discover` component is a React component that renders a page for discovering information related to the Ergo blockchain project. The component imports several other components from the `../components/discover` directory, including `DiscoverHero`, `Documents`, `ErgoExplorer`, `FAQ`, and `GrantsAndBounties`. These components are used to display various types of information related to the project, such as documentation, frequently asked questions, and grants and bounties available to developers.\n\nThe `Discover` component takes in two optional props, `documents` and `faq`, which are used to populate the `Documents` and `FAQ` components, respectively. If these props are not provided, the corresponding components will not be rendered.\n\nThe component also uses the `Layout` component from `../components/Layout` to provide a consistent layout for the page. The `Layout` component takes in a `title` prop, which is generated using the `useIntl` hook from the `react-intl` library. This hook is used to format the title message based on the user's locale.\n\nThe `Discover` component also includes several `div` elements with class names that are used to style the page with background images and blur effects.\n\nFinally, the component exports a `getStaticProps` function that is used by Next.js to fetch data from the Strapi API. This function fetches documents and FAQs from the API based on the user's locale, and returns them as props to the `Discover` component. The `revalidate` option is also set to 60 seconds, which tells Next.js to regenerate the page every 60 seconds to ensure that the data is up-to-date.\n\nOverall, the `Discover` component is a key part of the Ergo blockchain project's website, providing users with a centralized location to discover information about the project and its various resources.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Discover` component?\n- The `Discover` component is responsible for rendering various sub-components related to discovering information about the project.\n\n2.

What is the purpose of the `getStaticProps` function?\n- The `getStaticProps` function is used to fetch data from an external API and pass it as props to the `Discover` component. It also includes a `revalidate` property to specify how often the data should be revalidated."
