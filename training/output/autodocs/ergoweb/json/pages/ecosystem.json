  "summary": "The `Ecosystem` component is responsible for rendering the main page of the ecosystem section of the Ergoweb project. It imports several components from the `../components/ecosystem` directory, including `ChangingTheWorld`, `DApps`, `EcosystemHero`, `Favorites`, `FeaturesAndProjects`, `Roadmap`, and `Wiki`. These components are conditionally rendered based on the presence of certain props passed to the `Ecosystem` component.\n\nThe `Ecosystem` component also imports the `Layout` component from `../components/Layout`, which is used to provide a consistent layout for the page. The `Layout` component is passed a `title` prop, which is generated using the `useIntl` hook from the `react-intl` library. This hook is used to format the title message based on the user's locale.\n\nThe `Ecosystem` component defines a `Props` type, which specifies the shape of the props that can be passed to the component. These props include `apps`, `roadmap`, `projects`, `favorites`, and `chagingTheWorldProjects`, all of which are optional.\n\nThe `Ecosystem` component renders several `div` elements that are used to create a decorative background for the page. These elements have class names that are used to apply CSS styles to them.\n\nThe `Ecosystem` component also conditionally renders several child components based on the presence of certain props. If the `apps` prop is present, the `DApps` component is rendered with the `apps` prop passed to it. If the `roadmap` prop is present, the `Roadmap` component is rendered with the `roadmapItems` prop passed to it. The `Wiki`, `Favorites`, `FeaturesAndProjects`, and `ChangingTheWorld` components are similarly conditionally rendered based on the presence of their respective props.\n\nThe `Ecosystem` component also defines a `getServerSideProps` function, which is used to fetch data from the Strapi API. This function fetches data for the `apps`, `roadmap`, `projects`, `favorites`, and `chagingTheWorldProjects` props, and returns an object containing these props. This object is passed to the `Ecosystem` component as props when it is rendered on the server.\n\nOverall, the `Ecosystem` component is a high-level component that is responsible for rendering the main page of the ecosystem section of the Ergoweb project. It imports and conditionally renders several child components based on the presence of certain props, and fetches data for these props using the `getServerSideProps` function.",

What is the purpose of the `Ecosystem` component?\n- The `Ecosystem` component is responsible for rendering various components related to the project's ecosystem, such as DApps, Roadmap, Wiki, Favorites, FeaturesAndProjects, and ChangingTheWorld.\n\n2.

What is the purpose of the `getServerSideProps` function?\n- The `getServerSideProps` function is responsible for fetching data from the project's API endpoints related to DApps, Roadmap, FeaturesAndProjects, Favorites, and ChangingTheWorld, and returning them as props to be used by the `Ecosystem` component."
