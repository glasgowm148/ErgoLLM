  "summary": "This code exports a React component called `EcosystemPage` that renders the `Ecosystem` component from the `../../pages/ecosystem` file. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to render the `Ecosystem` component as a standalone page within the larger project. \n\nThe `title` property is used by the Storybook tool to display the name of the component in the UI. The `component` property specifies the component that will be rendered in the Storybook preview pane. \n\nThe `EcosystemPage` component is a functional component that simply renders the `Ecosystem` component. This allows the `Ecosystem` component to be easily reused in other parts of the project, while also providing a standalone page for users to view the ecosystem data. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport EcosystemPage from \"./components/EcosystemPage\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to the Ergoweb Ecosystem</h1>\n      <EcosystemPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `EcosystemPage` component is imported and rendered within the `App` component. This allows the `Ecosystem` component to be displayed as a standalone page within the larger Ergoweb project.",
