  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a React component called `Custom500Page`. This component is used to render a custom error page for HTTP status code 500, which is a server error. The component is imported from the `../../pages/500` file, which likely contains the actual markup and styling for the error page.\n\nThe `title` property in the object being exported is used by Storybook, a tool for developing and testing UI components, to display the name of the component in the Storybook UI. The `component` property specifies the actual component being rendered.\n\nThe `Custom500Page` function is a functional component that simply returns the `Custom500` component imported earlier. This allows the `Custom500` component to be used in other parts of the project by simply importing and rendering the `Custom500Page` component.\n\nOverall, this code is a small but important part of the larger ergoweb project, as it provides a custom error page for server errors that is consistent with the rest of the project's UI. It also demonstrates the use of Storybook to develop and test UI components in isolation. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport Custom500Page from \"./path/to/Custom500Page\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* other components */}\n      <Custom500Page />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Custom500 component?\n   - The Custom500 component is a page component for displaying a 500 error page.\n\n2. Where is the Custom500 component located in the project directory?\n   - The Custom500 component is located in the `pages` directory, specifically in a subdirectory called `500`.\n\n3. How is the Custom500 component being exported and used in other parts of the project?\n   - The Custom500 component is being exported as a default export and is being used as a component in the `Custom500Page` constant, which is then used elsewhere in the project."
