      "summary": "The code is a React component that exports a CommunityCard component. The purpose of this component is to display information about a community, such as its name, icon, and a brief description. The component is designed to be used in the larger ergoweb project as a reusable component that can be easily customized and integrated into different parts of the project.\n\nThe component imports two other components, CommunityCard and Dark, from their respective files. The Dark component is a wrapper that applies a dark theme to the CommunityCard component. This is achieved using the decorators property, which is an array of functions that wrap the component with additional functionality. In this case, the Dark component is used to apply a dark theme to the CommunityCard component.\n\nThe Template function is a higher-order function that takes an object of arguments and returns a new instance of the CommunityCard component with those arguments. This function is used to create a reusable template for the CommunityCard component that can be easily customized with different arguments.\n\nThe CommunityCardComponent is a named export that is bound to the Template function. This export is used to create an instance of the CommunityCard component with specific arguments. In this case, the arguments are the title, icon, and text properties, which are used to display information about the community.\n\nOverall, this code is a reusable component that can be used to display information about a community in the ergoweb project. It is designed to be easily customized and integrated into different parts of the project, and it uses a dark theme to provide a consistent look and feel across the project.",

  "summary": "The `communityCard.stories.jsx` file contains a reusable React component called `CommunityCard` that is designed to display information about a community within the ergoweb project. This component can be easily customized and integrated into different parts of the project, providing a consistent look and feel.\n\nThe `CommunityCard` component imports two other components: `CommunityCard` and `Dark`. The `Dark` component is a wrapper that applies a dark theme to the `CommunityCard` component using the `decorators` property, which is an array of functions that wrap the component with additional functionality.\n\nThe `Template` function is a higher-order function that takes an object of arguments and returns a new instance of the `CommunityCard` component with those arguments. This function is used to create a reusable template for the `CommunityCard` component that can be easily customized with different arguments.\n\nThe `CommunityCardComponent` is a named export that is bound to the `Template` function. This export is used to create an instance of the `CommunityCard` component with specific arguments, such as the `title`, `icon`, and `text` properties, which are used to display information about the community.\n\nFor example, to use the `CommunityCard` component in another part of the project, you would import it and then customize it with the desired properties:\n\n```jsx\nimport { CommunityCardComponent } from './communityCard.stories';\n\nfunction SomeComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CommunityCardComponent\n        title=\"Example Community\"\n        icon=\"example-icon\"\n        text=\"This is a brief description of the example community.\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CommunityCardComponent` is imported and used within the `SomeComponent` function. The `title`, `icon`, and `text` properties are customized to display information about the \"Example Community\". The `CommunityCard` component will be rendered with a dark theme, thanks to the `Dark` wrapper component.\n\nIn summary, the `communityCard.stories.jsx` file provides a reusable and customizable `CommunityCard` component that can be used to display information about communities within the ergoweb project. The component is designed to be easily integrated into different parts of the project and uses a dark theme to provide a consistent look and feel.",
