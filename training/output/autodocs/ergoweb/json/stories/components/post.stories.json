  "summary": "This code exports a configuration object and a PostComponent React component. The configuration object is used to configure the Post component, which is a shared component used in the ergoweb project. The configuration object specifies the title of the component, the component itself, and a decorator function that wraps the component in a Dark component. \n\nThe PostComponent is a React component that takes in props such as title, subtitle, author, date, image, tags, and url. These props are used to render a blog post on the ergoweb website. The Template function is used to render the Post component with the props passed in as arguments. The PostComponent is then bound to the Template function with the PostComponent.args object. \n\nThis code is used to create a reusable Post component that can be used throughout the ergoweb project to display blog posts. The configuration object and the PostComponent can be imported into other files in the project and used to render blog posts with different content. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { PostComponent } from \"../../components/shared/Post\";\n\nconst MyBlogPost = () => {\n  return (\n    <PostComponent \n      title=\"My Blog Post\"\n      subtitle=\"A great blog post about ergonomics\"\n      author=\"John Doe\"\n      date=\"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n      image=\"https://example.com/image.jpg\"\n      tags=\"ergonomics, health\"\n      url=\"/blog/my-blog-post\"\n    />\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `decorators` array in the export statement?\n   - The `decorators` array is used to wrap the `Post` component with the `Dark` component, which likely applies a dark theme to the post.\n2. What is the `Template` function used for?\n   - The `Template` function is used to create a reusable template for rendering the `Post` component with different props.\n3. What is the format of the `date` prop?\n   - The `date` prop is in ISO 8601 format (`\"2019-06-27T00:00:00.000Z\"`) and represents the date and time the post was published in UTC time zone."
