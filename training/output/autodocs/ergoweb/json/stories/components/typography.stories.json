  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a default object and a named export. The default export is an object that contains metadata about a typography component, while the named export is a functional component that renders the typography component.\n\nThe metadata object contains the following properties:\n- `title`: a string that represents the title of the component, which is used for documentation and testing purposes.\n- `component`: a reference to the `Typography` component that this metadata object describes.\n- `decorators`: an array of functions that wrap the `Story` component, which is a special component provided by the Storybook library that renders the `Typography` component. In this case, the only decorator is a function that wraps the `Story` component with a `Dark` component, which is presumably a component that applies a dark theme to the `Typography` component.\n\nThe named export, `TypographyComponent`, is a functional component that simply renders the `Typography` component. This component can be imported and used in other parts of the project.\n\nOverall, this code is likely part of a larger project that uses the Storybook library to document and test UI components. The `Typography` component is likely a reusable component that is used throughout the project, and the `Dark` component is likely a theme component that can be applied to other components as well. By using Storybook to document and test these components, the project can ensure that they are consistent and functional across different parts of the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the \"Dark\" component being imported and used as a decorator?\n   - The \"Dark\" component is being used as a decorator to provide a dark background for the \"Typography\" component when it is rendered.\n\n2. What other components are being used in this project?\n   - The only other component being used in this file is the \"Typography\" component, but it is possible that other components are being used elsewhere in the project.\n\n3. What is the expected output of the \"TypographyComponent\" function?\n   - The expected output of the \"TypographyComponent\" function is the \"Typography\" component being rendered."
