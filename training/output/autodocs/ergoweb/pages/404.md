The code above defines a custom 404 page for the ergoweb project using the Next.js framework and the react-intl library for internationalization. The purpose of this code is to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing error page for when a user navigates to a non-existent page on the ergoweb website. 

The code imports the `NextPage` type from the `next` module and the `FormattedMessage` and `useIntl` functions from the `react-intl` module. It also imports a `Layout` component from a local file in the `components` directory. 

The `Custom404` function is defined as a React functional component that returns JSX. It uses the `useIntl` hook to access the `intl` object, which is used to format the page title using the `formatMessage` method. The `Layout` component is used to provide a consistent layout for the error page, with the `title` prop set to the formatted title and the `footer` prop set to `false` to remove the footer from the page. 

The JSX returned by the `Custom404` function includes several `div` elements with class names that are used to style the page with CSS. The main content of the page is contained within a `div` with class name `max-w-[1300px] mx-auto p-4 relative z-10 flex flex-col lg:flex-row mb-20`, which contains two child `div` elements. The first child `div` has a class name of `lg:w-2/3` and is empty, while the second child `div` has a class name of `lg:w-1/3` and contains the error message and a brief description of the error. 

The error message is defined using the `FormattedMessage` component, which takes an `id` prop and a `defaultMessage` prop. The `id` prop is used to reference a message string in the translation files, while the `defaultMessage` prop is used as a fallback if no translation is available. The error message is displayed in a large font size and is styled with a bold font and a gray color. 

Overall, this code provides a custom 404 error page for the ergoweb project that is visually appealing and user-friendly. It uses the Next.js framework and the react-intl library to provide internationalization support and a consistent layout for the error page.
