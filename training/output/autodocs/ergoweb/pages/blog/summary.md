The `[id].tsx` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/pages/blog` folder is responsible for rendering individual blog post pages within the ergoweb project. This file contains a React component called `Post` and a server-side function called `getServerSideProps`.

The `Post` component takes in two props: `post` and `posts`. The `post` prop contains data about the current blog post, while the `posts` prop contains a list of all blog posts. The component imports several other components and libraries, such as `Layout`, `ReactMarkdown`, `Image`, `Button`, `Link`, and `BlogPosts`.

The component first checks if the current post has an associated image and sets the `hasImage` and `imageUrl` variables accordingly. It then renders the blog post page, which includes the post title, author, date, tags, subtitle, content, and social media sharing buttons. The `ReactMarkdown` component is used to render the post content in markdown format, while the `Button` component is used to render a button that links back to the blog homepage. The `Link` component wraps the social media sharing buttons and links them to their respective sharing URLs.

Here's an example of how the `Post` component might be used:

```jsx
<Post post={currentPost} posts={allPosts} />
```

The `getServerSideProps` function is an asynchronous function that fetches data for the current post and all blog posts from a Strapi API. It takes in a `context` object containing information about the current request, including query parameters. The function first fetches the current post data by filtering the posts by permalink and locale. It then fetches all blog posts by filtering the posts by type and sorting them by date in descending order. If the current post data is not found, the function returns a `notFound` object. Otherwise, it returns an object containing the `post` and `posts` data.

This component is likely used in conjunction with other components and pages to create a complete blog website. For example, a `BlogList` component might render a list of blog post previews, and when a user clicks on a preview, they are taken to the individual blog post page rendered by the `Post` component.
