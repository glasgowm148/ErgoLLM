The `News` component is responsible for rendering the blog news section of the Ergoweb project. It imports the `useIntl` hook from the `react-intl` library, which is used to format the title of the page. The component receives two optional props, `news` and `media`, which are used to display the blog news and media posts respectively.

The `News` component returns a JSX element that contains several `div` elements with class names that are used for styling purposes. The `Layout` component is used to render the page layout and receives the `title` prop, which is formatted using the `useIntl` hook. The `BlogNews` component is conditionally rendered based on the presence of the `news` prop.

The `getServerSideProps` function is an asynchronous function that is used to fetch the blog news and media posts from the Strapi API. It receives a `context` object as an argument, which contains information about the request, such as the locale. The `fetch` function is used to make HTTP requests to the Strapi API, and the response is parsed using the `json` method. The `data` property of the response is returned as the value of the `news` and `media` props.

This component can be used in the larger Ergoweb project to display the latest blog news and media posts. The `News` component can be imported and rendered in other components or pages of the project. The `getServerSideProps` function can be used to fetch the latest blog news and media posts on the server-side, which can improve the performance of the application by reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded on the client-side. 

Example usage:

```
import News from '../components/News';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Ergoweb</h1>
      <News />
    </div>
  );
}
```
