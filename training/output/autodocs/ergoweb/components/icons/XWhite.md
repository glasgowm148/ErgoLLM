The code defines a React component called `SvgXWhite` that renders a white X inside a circle. The component takes in props, which are spread onto the SVG element. The SVG has a width and height of 43, and the `path` elements inside it define the shape of the X and circle.

The first `path` element defines the circle by drawing a closed shape with a radius of 21.26 (half the width/height of the SVG) and a stroke width of 2. The circle is white because the `stroke` property is set to "#fff".

The second `path` element defines the X by drawing a closed shape with four lines. The lines are drawn using absolute coordinates, with the starting point and ending point of each line specified. The X is white because the `fill` property is set to "#fff".

This component could be used in various places throughout the larger project to indicate a close or cancel action. For example, it could be used as a button to close a modal or dismiss a notification. It could also be used as an icon in a navigation bar to indicate a back or home action. The component is reusable and customizable through its props, such as changing the size or color of the SVG. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import SvgXWhite from 'path/to/SvgXWhite';

function CloseButton({ onClick }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      <SvgXWhite width={20} height={20} />
    </button>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `SvgXWhite` component is used inside a button that triggers a close action when clicked. The component is customized to have a width and height of 20, and is wrapped inside a button element with an `onClick` handler.
