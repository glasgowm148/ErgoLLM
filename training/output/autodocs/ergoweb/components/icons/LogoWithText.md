The code defines a React component called `SvgLogoWithText` that renders an SVG image of a logo with text. The SVG image has a width of 213 and a height of 82. The logo is made up of two `path` elements that define the shape of the logo and the text. The `className` attribute of the `path` elements is used to set the fill color of the logo and text to black or white depending on the theme (light or dark). 

The component takes in `props` as an argument, but it is not used in the component. The component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project.

This component can be used in the larger project as a logo for the application. It can be imported and rendered in the header or footer of the application to provide branding and visual identity. The component can also be customized by passing in props to change the size, color, or other attributes of the logo and text. 

Example usage:

```
import SvgLogoWithText from 'path/to/SvgLogoWithText';

const Header = () => (
  <header>
    <SvgLogoWithText width={150} height={50} />
  </header>
);
```

In this example, the `SvgLogoWithText` component is imported and rendered in the header of the application with a width of 150 and a height of 50. This allows for customization of the logo size to fit the design of the application.
