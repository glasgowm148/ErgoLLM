The code defines a React component called `SvgErgoRaffle` that renders an SVG image. The SVG image consists of two `path` elements that define the shape and color of the image. The first `path` element is filled with white color in light mode and black color in dark mode. The second `path` element is filled with a bright red color. 

The purpose of this component is to display an image of the Ergo Raffle logo. It can be used in various parts of the ErgoWeb project, such as in the header or footer of the website, or in marketing materials. 

To use this component in a React application, it can be imported and rendered like any other React component. For example:

```
import SvgErgoRaffle from 'path/to/SvgErgoRaffle';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to ErgoWeb</h1>
      <SvgErgoRaffle />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This will render the Ergo Raffle logo below the heading. The component can also accept props to customize its size and other attributes of the SVG image.
