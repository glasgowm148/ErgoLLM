The code defines a React component called `SvgLogoWhite` that renders a white logo in the shape of a stylized letter "E". The logo is composed of two paths, one that forms the letter "E" and another that outlines the shape of the logo.

The `SvgLogoWhite` component takes in `props` as an argument, which can be used to customize the SVG element's attributes. The SVG element has a width and height of 82 pixels and has no fill color by default. The `fill` attribute is set to white for both paths, resulting in a white logo.

This component can be used in the larger project as a reusable logo component that can be easily inserted into other components or pages. For example, it can be used as the logo for the Ergoweb website or as an icon for a button that links back to the homepage.

Here is an example of how the `SvgLogoWhite` component can be used in a React component:

```
import React from 'react';
import SvgLogoWhite from './SvgLogoWhite';

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <SvgLogoWhite />
      <nav>
        {/* navigation links */}
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

In this example, the `SvgLogoWhite` component is used in the `Header` component to display the logo at the top of the page. The logo is followed by a navigation menu.
