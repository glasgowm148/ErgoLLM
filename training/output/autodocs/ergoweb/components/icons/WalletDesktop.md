The code defines a React component called `SvgWalletDesktop` that renders an SVG image of a wallet on a desktop computer. The component takes in `props` as an argument, which can be used to customize the SVG image. The SVG image has a width and height of 18 pixels and is filled with white color.

The SVG image consists of a path element that defines the shape of the wallet. The path element is defined using a series of commands that specify the starting point, the curves, and the lines that make up the shape of the wallet. The path element is filled with white color.

The wallet has a rectangular shape with rounded corners. It has a flap at the top that is open, revealing the inside of the wallet. The wallet has a total of three sections: two on the left and one on the right. The two sections on the left are smaller and are meant to hold cards, while the section on the right is larger and is meant to hold cash.

The code exports the `SvgWalletDesktop` component as the default export, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, if the project has a component that displays a user's wallet balance, it could use the `SvgWalletDesktop` component to display an icon of a wallet next to the balance.

Example usage:

```
import SvgWalletDesktop from 'path/to/SvgWalletDesktop';

const WalletBalance = ({ balance }) => (
  <div>
    <SvgWalletDesktop />
    <span>{balance}</span>
  </div>
);
```

In this example, the `WalletBalance` component displays an SVG image of a wallet using the `SvgWalletDesktop` component and the user's wallet balance using a `span` element.
