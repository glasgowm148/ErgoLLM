The code defines a React component called `SvgMenuClose` that renders an SVG image of a close icon for a menu. The component takes in props as an argument, which can be used to customize the SVG image. The SVG image has a width of 50 and a height of 51, and it is filled with white color.

The SVG image consists of two paths that form an X shape. The first path starts from the top left corner of the SVG and goes to the bottom right corner, while the second path starts from the bottom left corner and goes to the top right corner. Both paths are filled with white color.

This component can be used in a larger project that requires a close icon for a menu. For example, it can be used in a mobile app that has a navigation drawer that can be closed by tapping on a close icon. The component can be imported and used in the code as follows:

```
import SvgMenuClose from 'path/to/SvgMenuClose';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>Menu Item 1</li>
          <li>Menu Item 2</li>
          <li>Menu Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <SvgMenuClose />
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `SvgMenuClose` component is used as the close icon for the navigation menu. When the user taps on the icon, the menu will be closed. The component can also be customized by passing props to it, such as changing the color of the icon or the size of the SVG image.
