The code defines a React component called `JoinUs` that renders a section of a web page with links to various social media platforms and community resources related to the Ergo blockchain platform. The component imports the `FormattedMessage` component from the `react-intl` library, which is used to provide translations for the text displayed on the page. 

The `cards` array contains objects that define the properties of each link card, including the title, text, icon, and URL. The `FormattedMessageFixed` function is a wrapper around the `FormattedMessage` component that is used to pass the `defaultMessage` and `id` props to the `FormattedMessage` component. 

The `JoinUs` component renders two different layouts depending on the screen size. On smaller screens, the cards are displayed in a horizontal scrollable list, while on larger screens, the cards are displayed in a grid layout. The `CommunityCard` component is used to render each link card by passing the appropriate properties from the `cards` array. 

The component also includes a paragraph of text that encourages users to get involved with the Ergo community and provides a link to the Contributing page on the Ergonaut website. 

Overall, this component serves as a central hub for users to discover and connect with the Ergo community across various social media platforms and community resources. It provides a user-friendly and visually appealing way to access these resources and encourages community engagement. 

Example usage: 

```jsx
import JoinUs from './JoinUs';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Ergo Community!</h1>
      <JoinUs />
    </div>
  );
}
```
