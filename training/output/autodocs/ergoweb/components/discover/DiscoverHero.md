The `DiscoverERG` component is a React component that renders a section of the Ergoweb project's website. The purpose of this component is to provide users with various resources to learn about and interact with the Ergo blockchain platform. 

The component imports several dependencies, including `Link` and `FormattedMessage` from the `next/link` and `react-intl` libraries respectively. It also imports the `getIconComponentByName` function from a custom `icons-map` utility file, and two SVG icons, `DiscoverErgHero` and `DiscoverErgHeroLight`, from custom `icons` files. Finally, it imports a custom `Button` component.

The component defines several variables using the `useIntl` hook to format text messages for internationalization. These variables are used as the text for the various buttons that link to different resources related to Ergo. 

The component renders a container div with the id `DiscoverERG` and several child divs that contain the various resources. The first child div contains an SVG image of the Ergo logo, which changes depending on whether the user has selected a light or dark theme. The second child div contains a title and a paragraph describing Ergo. The remaining child divs contain buttons that link to different resources, such as the Ergo manifesto, documentation, and a YouTube channel. 

The component also uses the `Link` component from the `next/link` library to render a button that links to the Ergonaut website, which provides additional resources for learning about Ergo. 

Overall, the `DiscoverERG` component provides users with a centralized location to access various resources related to Ergo, making it easier for users to learn about and interact with the platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useIntl` hook and how is it used in this code?
- The `useIntl` hook is used to access the internationalization API provided by the `react-intl` library. It is used in this code to format messages for the buttons displayed on the page.

2. What is the significance of the `DiscoverErgHero` and `DiscoverErgHeroLight` components?
- These components are used to display different versions of the hero image depending on whether the user has selected a light or dark theme. They are imported from separate files and have different viewBox and className properties.

3. How are the buttons on the page linked to external URLs or internal pages?
- The buttons are created using the `Button` component and have `url` and `newTab` props that determine the destination of the link and whether it should open in a new tab. The last button is created using the `Link` component from the `next/link` library and has a `href` prop that determines the internal page it links to.
