The code above defines the styles for the discover section of the ergoweb project. The discover section is composed of three frames and two blurred images. The frames are positioned absolutely and have different sizes and backgrounds. The first frame has a light background, while the second and third frames have a dark background. The blurred images are also positioned absolutely and have different sizes and backgrounds. The first blurred image has a light background, while the second blurred image has a fixed background. The mix-blend-mode property is used to blend the first blurred image with the background.

The code also includes media queries to adjust the styles for different screen sizes. For screens smaller than the medium breakpoint, the first frame is hidden, and the second and third frames are scaled down. The blurred images are also hidden, except for the third blurred image, which is positioned differently. For screens smaller than the small breakpoint, the discover image is positioned differently, and the discover container has a different margin.

This code is used to define the styles for the discover section of the ergoweb project. The discover section is an important part of the project, as it showcases the features and benefits of the product. The different frames and blurred images are used to create a visually appealing and informative section that engages the user. The media queries ensure that the section is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes. Overall, this code plays an important role in creating a great user experience for the ergoweb project.
