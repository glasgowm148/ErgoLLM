The code above is a Sass file that defines font styles and sizes for the ergoweb project. It imports a variables file that contains variables for media queries. The code defines four font families: Vinila Extended, Vinila Extended Bold, Vinila Extended Light, and Roboto. It also defines font sizes for various headings, subtitles, and body text. 

The `@font-face` rule is used to define custom fonts for the project. It specifies the font family, font display, and source of the font files. The `src` property specifies the location of the font files in different formats, such as WOFF2, WOFF, TTF, and SVG. The `font-display` property specifies how the font should be displayed while it is being loaded. The `local("")` value is used to prioritize locally installed fonts before loading the web font.

The code also defines styles for different elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links. It uses class selectors to target specific elements and applies styles such as font size, font family, and color. The `@media` rule is used to define styles for different screen sizes. It uses the variables defined in the variables file to specify the maximum width of the screen for each media query.

This code is used to define the typography styles for the ergoweb project. It ensures consistency in font sizes and styles across the project. The defined font families are used throughout the project to maintain a consistent look and feel. The media queries ensure that the font sizes are adjusted for different screen sizes, making the project responsive. 

Example usage:

To use the `Vinila Extended Bold` font family for a heading, add the following CSS code:

```
h1 {
  font-family: "Vinila Extended Bold", sans-serif;
}
```

To use the `font-subtitle-1` class for a subtitle, add the following HTML code:

```
<h2 class="font-subtitle-1">Subtitle text</h2>
```
