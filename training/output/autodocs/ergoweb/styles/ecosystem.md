This code defines the styling for various elements related to the ecosystem feature of the Ergoweb project. The code is written in Sass, a preprocessor for CSS, and is organized into different classes based on the type of element being styled. 

The `ecosystem-frame-1`, `ecosystem-frame-2`, and `ecosystem-frame-3` classes define the styling for three different frames that are displayed on the page. These frames have different dimensions and backgrounds, and are positioned absolutely on the page. The `dark` class is used to define the styling for these frames when the page is in dark mode. 

The `ecosystem-frame-4` and `ecosystem-frame-5` classes are hidden by default, but are displayed when the screen size is below a certain threshold. These frames have different dimensions and backgrounds, and are positioned absolutely on the page. The `dark` class is used to define the styling for these frames when the page is in dark mode. 

The `ecosystem-blur-1` and `ecosystem-blur-2` classes define the styling for two different blurred backgrounds that are displayed on the page. These backgrounds have different dimensions and are positioned absolutely on the page. The `dark` class is used to define the styling for `ecosystem-blur-2` when the page is in dark mode. 

The `ecosystem-blur-3` class is displayed when the screen size is below a certain threshold. This background has different dimensions and is positioned absolutely on the page. The `dark` class is used to define the styling for this background when the page is in dark mode. 

Overall, this code is responsible for defining the styling for various elements related to the ecosystem feature of the Ergoweb project. These elements include frames and blurred backgrounds that are displayed on the page. The code is organized into different classes based on the type of element being styled, and uses the `dark` class to define the styling for these elements when the page is in dark mode.

## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@import "./_variables.scss";` statement at the beginning of the code?
   
   This statement imports the `_variables.scss` file into the current file, which contains variables that can be used throughout the code.

2. What is the significance of the `@media` queries in this code?
   
   The `@media` queries define styles that apply only when the screen size is below a certain width, allowing for responsive design.

3. What is the purpose of the `.dark` class used in some of the CSS selectors?
   
   The `.dark` class is used to define styles that apply when the website is in "dark mode", which is likely a feature of the website that this code is a part of.
