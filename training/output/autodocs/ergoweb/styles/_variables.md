This code defines variables for different screen sizes in pixels. These variables can be used throughout the project to ensure that the layout and design of the website is optimized for different screen sizes. 

For example, if a developer wants to set the font size for a specific element to be larger on larger screens, they can use a media query with the $lg variable to target screens with a width of 1024px or larger:

```
@media only screen and (min-width: $lg) {
  .element {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

This code can also be used in conjunction with a CSS preprocessor like Sass to make it easier to write and maintain stylesheets. By defining variables for screen sizes, developers can avoid hard-coding specific pixel values throughout their code, making it easier to update and modify the design of the website in the future.

Overall, this code serves as a foundation for responsive design in the ergoweb project, allowing developers to create a website that looks and functions well on a variety of different devices and screen sizes.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of these variables?**\
A smart developer might wonder what these variables are used for and how they are relevant to the ergoweb project. These variables are likely used for defining breakpoints for responsive design, allowing the website to adjust its layout based on the user's screen size.

2. **How are these variables used in the project?**\
A smart developer might want to know how these variables are implemented in the ergoweb project. They may be used in CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the screen size, or in JavaScript to trigger certain functions based on the user's device.

3. **Are there any other variables or constants used in the project?**\
A smart developer might be curious if there are any other variables or constants used in the ergoweb project, and how they are defined and utilized. It's possible that there are other variables used for color schemes, font sizes, or other design elements that are not shown in this code snippet.
