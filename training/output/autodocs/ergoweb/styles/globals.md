This code is responsible for styling various components and elements within the ErgoWeb project. It primarily uses Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework, and imports several SCSS files for different sections of the project, such as home, community, blog, and more.

The code defines several custom CSS classes for specific purposes, such as adding shadows to elements, styling the Swiper carousel, hiding scrollbars, and formatting text in blog posts. For example, the `.themeShadow` class applies a drop-shadow effect to an element, while the `.swiper-button-next` and `.swiper-button-prev` classes style the navigation buttons of the Swiper carousel.

The code also includes media queries to ensure responsive design and adapt the styling for different screen sizes. For instance, the `.legal-frame-1` and `.legal-blur-1` classes are hidden on screens with a width smaller than the `$md` breakpoint.

Additionally, the code handles the styling for dark mode by using the `.dark` class. Elements with this class applied will have their colors and backgrounds adjusted to suit a dark theme.

Here's an example of how the `.themeShadow` class can be used:

```html
<div class="themeShadow">
  <!-- Content with a shadow effect -->
</div>
```

Overall, this code plays a crucial role in defining the visual appearance and user experience of the ErgoWeb project, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across different sections and devices.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the different imported SCSS files?**

   The imported SCSS files are individual stylesheets for different components or sections of the ErgoWeb project. They are imported to keep the code modular and organized, making it easier to maintain and update the styles for specific parts of the project.

2. **What are the different classes used for shadows and how do they differ?**

   There are several classes used for applying shadows to elements, such as `.themeShadow`, `.highlightsShadow`, `.homeInfo-shadow`, and `.input-shadow`. Each class applies a different type and intensity of shadow, using the `box-shadow` or `drop-shadow` CSS properties. The differences between these classes are the values used for the shadow properties, such as color, blur radius, and offset.

3. **What is the purpose of the `.dark` class and how is it used in the code?**

   The `.dark` class is used to apply dark mode styles to elements in the ErgoWeb project. It is used in combination with other classes to override the default styles and apply dark mode-specific styles, such as changing background colors, text colors, and box shadows. This is done by using the `.dark` class as a parent selector, followed by the specific element or class that needs to be styled for dark mode.
